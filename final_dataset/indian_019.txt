Letter from 31st Punjabis, 11 December 1915.
From Jan Phuman Singh, 31St Punjabi, attached 47th Sikhs, to a friend in India (Gurmukhi, 1/12/15). “Do not be anxious about me. For eighteen years I have eaten salt at the hand of our Emperor and now I shall repay him with my loyalty. Now is my opportunity. The man who at this time does his duty by the government with absolute loyalty need have no fear for the future…..it would be difficult to find another government so good as ours, under which no man is harassed” (Green envelope – passed)
