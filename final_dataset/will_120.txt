Visitiors Chateau  December 8, 1917     My dear Birdwood.  I am just leaving for England  having had the great pleasure, yesterday, of seeing my Newfoundland lads out - with great honour - from the Cambrai fight. They took Masniĕres on Nov 20 & held the line into Dec 3 when the remnant was relieved. - They are 240 bayonets now.  I write only to wish you good  luck & to express my belief that you have not only the qualities of a soldier but the infinite tact required to make  the most and bring out the best in the Australian army. - I still back my  original prophecy. Yours very truly,  W.E.Davidson
