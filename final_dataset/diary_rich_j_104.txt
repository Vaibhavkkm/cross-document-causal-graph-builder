March 10th. Saturday. After a short march around the block we were all taken into the lecture room where Col. Stephen spoke upon "Sentrys and Guards" for 30 minutes; we then retired to the parade ground and carried through the ceremony of changing guard and posting a guard. After which there was some "standing loading" with live cartridges, and later squad drill. My shoulder is very painful and any exercise down with the right shoulder is slow and very sore. Afternoon:--A lecture by Major Harris on the new formation of a Company in attack. It differs little from the formation practiced by 1st. Bn. but in the main features it was similar. After the lecture it was practiced in the mud as a drill movement and was very simple. In carrying out this system of attack it seemed to work splendidly. Each section is trained to take any special work. The bombers are not essentially bombers, but really bayonet men until the trench is taken then if there is bombing to be done they are called out to do it. This will most likely be on either of the flanks therefore they occupy the outside position.                                          Position of sections in Trench.

- 15 - At 5 p.m. Capt. Maltby lectured on "March Discipline" is very good, and clear style. He said that food, water dress smoking and pace regulation, are the foremost features to consider on the march. Platoon commandes should see that the men wash their feet after a march and see that their boots and socks when issued fit properly. No compliments are given on the march. If two Battalions pass a salute from the commander is sufficient.
