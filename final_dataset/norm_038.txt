Dearest Mother & all at Home, Just a line to let you know that I am quite well & I hope this finds you all in the very best of health & happiness also. I have just got over an attack of bowel trouble, lasting 3 days, but I am glad to say that our Dr has quite fixed me up again. I put it down to the same old diet which we have every day, & is more of less affecting the larger portion of our 1st Division in the same way, but the Dr allowed me a couple of tins of milk & a couple of tins of Arrowroot & with a spell of 3 days off duty & a change of diet, I am pleased to say I am myself again. We expect to be relieved soon & this will enable our chaps to pick up their old dash again & with the assistance of a good spell, be quite up to their 25th April form, so that is something for the enemy, whom they have to meet, to look forward to. Nothing much has been doing lately, that I am allowed to speak of, & beyond a 
little shelling & bomb throwing in the day time & a little musketry & machine gun fire at night time, things are just the same as last week. To-night a German Taube & a British Bi-plane were up over our positions at the same time, and everybody was eagerly looking forward to a scrap, but one was frightened, & the other wasn't game, so there was "nothing doing" much to the boys disappointment. I wrote you a long letter of 16 pages (a few pages) lately & I hope you received them alright. I have reconsidered what I said to you about promotion, & I think I'll stay where I am. I'll tell you about it when I hear more about it. Well, Mother dear, I hope you are all well, What do you think of my proposal re- the house? Think it over & don't hurry about it. How is every-body at home. Give them all my love & tell them that the Australians are still holding their positions, altho' we can easily do with any amount of reinforcements. Send the Stay-at-Homes out here, it won't do them any harm. Well, no more news at present, Mother, so I close with the best of love to all and an extra ration for yourself from your loving Son Norman.


P.S. I have just received Mabs letter & "Table Talk" dated 16/6/15, & am glad  to know its cold there, because its damned hot here & the flies are terrible
