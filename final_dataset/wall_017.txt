Arabian Desert. February 8th, 1916.  Dear Mum, Well here we are again. I am still well & I hope you are the same. I wrote a P.C. the other day to you but I didn't say much. We are in Reserve here about 10 miles in rear of our front line, we are just drilling most of the time but we get some Outposts to do now & again. Most of the Australian & New Zealand Troops are down here But there is not much doing yet. I fancy that we will be shifting on to France about the Spring. But I suppose it all depends on how things go here. I hope Blanche is well again by now. & buzzing around as usual. I was at Cairo the day before we shifted down here & I got a couple of pieces of Tapestry for you. I don't know whether you will like them or not but I thought that it would be alright. It is fairly good stuff. The smallest piece cost £2/10/0. It is all hand made. I thought it would do for something or other. I sent Ev a small parcel also at the same time. Well  Mum I must close now with love to all from, "Wall"
