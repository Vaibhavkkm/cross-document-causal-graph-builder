November 20th. Monday. I washed some clothes and just knocked about absently today. I find there are some 1,500 patients in the temporary hospital here, mostly men with trench feet. I was told it takes up to five weeks to cure a bad case of trench feet, but they only remain here over night. The hospital is entirely of tents, clear white square tents without any attempt being made to disguise them by paint splashes from the German airmen. This place was visited every night for a long time and bombs dropped. One bomb killed 9 and wounded 20. The fellows about have become very frightened of aeroplanes and if there are any Taubs about they go away up on to the hill out of the way. - 19 - I have posted a parcel to Brother Bert with three diaries dating from August to October, also some old letters and two copper shell bands. This clears me right out of diaries now. Somehow or other I hate to send these roughly written day to day entries away to be read by others. They represent my own miseries without any covering of paint and powder, and even if miseries they can hardly be read correctly so far away as Australia amongst strange surroundings and altered conditions. But Bert will be considerate and forgiving I am sure.
