Commandant's inspection at 9.30 am  Our lines were in A.1. order. Heard that Col Elliott has been killed Am anxiously  waiting to hear more news & particulars All sorts of reports are rife Native risings, as Somaliland
 
Mad Mullah's etc. Heard that 2000 mules from Franch have arrived to take the place of our horses which they intend to send in their place Heard from O.R. Sergeant that Col Elliott is alright! Capt Milne's ASC is with us & he was wounded at the peninsula. Milne is going to  stop with us he has told us many stories of the front etc. Lt Eller had a letter from Major Bennet from Gallopoli, today two men that had deserted the 6th Bn Transport here for the port they were sent back bringing with them the letter Major Bennet writes that "It is good O here now and we are losing very few men but our casualties have been ern enormous" I took out a number of the men mounted this afternoon & drilled them as a Troop (Light Horse) We got on splendidly & the men enjoyed it - It is like old times handling a troop.
