I
My dearest Mother & all at Home

It has only snowed once yet Just a line to let you all know that I am still doing well, & hope to tell you all about London soon. I am still confined to my bed, but my diarrhoea is quite better, but the Dr told me that he wants my temperature to come down a little more, & then he will allow me to get up. It keeps down to normal for 4 or 5 days, & then suddenly takes it into its head to hop up to 99 ° Etc, & this “narks” me. Well, I’ve seen cousin Harriet Cole. She came down from Gravesend last Sunday to see me, & a long distance it is too (45 miles). She is a dear old soul, but is very active. She resembles Mrs Algie somewhat, only is hardly so severe looking (if I can use the word) & is also like Mrs May in the face. She was awfully nice & kind & brought me eggs & sweets & told me all about her life & also about the rest of the family. Julia Roberts is too old to come so far in this weather, & they tell me that they have a bed & room for me when I am ready to come, & Harriet is coming to fetch me. They have had the Zeppelins down their way & just in the street at the back of their premises, so they get a little excitement at times to break the monotony.
Harriet seems to have had a pretty hard time of it all thro’ life, & has still Lucy (her brothers child) living at her expense, & she has had her taught shorthand and typewriting, & is now in employment somewhere in London. Anyhow Harriet is looking well & keeping well, & she says that all at Home are well. I believe she has written to you. She asked me all about Will Johnson & Aunt Jessie, & told me all about them whilst they were in London, & some of it is very funny. I had a cablegram despatched to you soon after I arrived & I wondered if you got is alright, & hope it did not frighten you all. Several of our battery is in England & two of them are in this hospital, but in different Wards. Nellie Wheelers brother has been wounded, & is in Hospital at Birmingham Well, what do you think of the Dardanelles now, eh; A lovely mess that has been hasn't it, & at what a cost too. Enough to make the poor fellows turn in their graves. Well, anyhow, I’m very glad there is no Anzac to go back to, & I don't mind where they send me after this. It was a terrible place to exist in.

I had the honor of having the first gun ashore but I am sorry for the one who had the last gun. The news only came out last night about the withdrawl, so I am eagerly awaiting the news. Talking about the first gun ashore. Cousin Harriet sent me a Melbourne “Age” 25th October & in it I was surprised to see that there had been a discussion as to who the honor belonged of landing the first gun, & in the paper, was a letter from one of our returned men (Jack Barker) & he had written to say that it was the 4th Battery & the the gun was in charge of “the most popular & efficient Sergeant Norman Ellsworth”. I nearly fainted when I read it. I showed it to Harriet when she came down & she had not seen it or knew anything about it. Isn’t it strange that it should be the very paper with my name in it. Of course I cut the piece out & have it. I had the only gun & was the first ashore of any battery on the Sunday 25th April. No other gun got into Action on the Peninsular on that Sunday (except mine) & the rest of our guns & those of other batteries came ashore next & succeeding days. True, a mountain (Indian) battery was on the peninsular before me, but they are not called field guns. I am still on Fish diet & getting on great & the Red Cross people cater for all our wants 
I am going to the Chapel on Christmas morning to service, & am looking forward to going to a service in St Pauls Cathedral and Westminster Abbey later on. We are to get 6 weeks furlough on being discharged from Hospital (This is for Enterics, the other sick & wounded only get 14 days) & I'll have £35 or thereabouts to spend, as we are not allowed to draw anything whilst in Hospital, altho’ I have got £2 in my belt, so am not broke; Of course we can get out & go to Epsom every day & the nurses don’t say anything (altho’ we are not supposed to go out) Well, how are you all at Home? How I think of you all everyday, & long to see you all. Anyhow the day is not far off when this confounded War will be over & I’ll be home again. [[??]] I say, what do you think of Vin Yardley; he is in England too. Apparently they would not have him at the Peninsular at any price. He has a very bad name, but how the deuce he got here, goodness only knows. Give my love to all at home & elsewhere & a special ration for dear Mab, George, Chas & Rupert & Floss & an extra special whack for your dear self from Your loving son Norman. P.S. I’ve had no mail since September. N.
