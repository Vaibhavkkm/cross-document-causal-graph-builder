Dearest Mother & all at Home, Just a line to let you know that I received your most welcome letter to-day, also one from dear Mab, one from Charl, also an "Australasian" from him & a "Table Talk" from Mab, & May Tilton wrote me a nice long letter too, as well as enclosing an envelope & piece of writing paper, which is most welcome as writing materiel is simply a treasure here, and envelopes cannot be bought for £. I also received your writing materiel as well & I am now availing myself of it, altho' I cannot give you a great deal of news, worst luck, but what I do, is fairly good & I am glad to say that we are nice & "comfy" & are just waiting for the word "go" & we are going to thrash the Turks off the face of the Peninsular altogether. General Legge came into my Gun Pit the other day, & told us that the Artillery would be quite sufficent to shift the Turks from their present position, & all one had to do after this little performance would be, to go out with a cane & bring in those that were not killed as prisoners. Our howitzer artillery are doing magnificent work & when the shells burst in the Turks trenches, it is just like a miniature earthquake. I only wish we were armed with them instead of what we already have, altho' our 
Guns are doing very good work & cause the Turks a lot of trouble. The Turks are firing a lot of naval shells at us now, & this would almost seem as if they have mounted some guns from their unemployed Navy. The shells are about 15 inches long, by about 8½ inches in diameter; fortunately one can hear them coming & it is rather amusing to see the boys all scamper off in different directions to try & dodge the "cow", & after it has lobbed or gone by, out they all come from their "funk holes", laughing & joking just as if it was a huge cracker. They do very little damage, however, & some of them, in fact, most of them are too lazy or tired to burst & merely fall with a tremendous thud. Of course, if they hit a gun pit, its "good night" Gun pit. but they do not fire consistenly & one never can tell where they will land. In fact, they land anywhere but at the target aimed at, but nevertheless, we do not take any unnecessary risks & avail ourselves of cover on all possible occasions. Deleted by censor 
The fresh Australians landed down there last week & received their baptism of fire, & have created a favourable impression on both the Turks & our side. The great fight is for Achi Baba, & when that place falls, expert opinion says it will be the beginning of the end. It is said to be very strongly fortified & the hill itself is said to be completely honeycomed out, & inside is one mass of machine guns & howitzers. I suppose people are getting a little impatient at the Allies taking so long over it, but let them only see the place, & at the same time remember, that the Gallipoli Peninsular was considered, by military experts, to be "Impregnable". When the big advance begins, & it wont be long now, people will then be able to see what sort of troops are engaged here, & to prove that they are not "second raters" Let them remember we are fighting a fresh enemy & have had to gain our footing & these Turks have been months digging themselves in & they have made a good job of it too. The success of the Australians was due to the self courage & individual judgement, as well as the mad, frantic desire to get "into it" & stir up somebody with their bayonets. It did not matter who it was to be, Turk, German, Austrian or anyone else, they would have charged & taken the place just the same. Just to prove how the Australians are enjoying themselves, when there is going to be a night attack, one can't buy a place in the main firing trench, & men are known to have refused £2 for their positions during the fighting. They stand up in 
the trenches & yell out "Come on, well give you Allah", & actually let the Turks get right to within 20 yards, then open up with terrific volleys & mow them down in hundreds. In some instances they let some Turks actually get into our Trenches & then tickle them up with the bayonet. I've met 2 more Christ Church Choir boys here, Albert Charles Prosser, & Spencer Hoskins, so just let the vicar know & to put them on the list at the Church door, if they are not already on it. Prosser ran away from home & enlisted in New South Wales Infantry (2nd Battalion) & was wounded the first day with shrapnel in the back & the bullet is still embedded in his back, between the spine & kidney & the Dr says it will take some time for it to work out of the muscle & then they will operate on him. He sneaked back unbeknown to the Authorities & is in the firing line again & has been through another bayonet charge. Hows that eh, Mum. He enlisted under the name of Albert Charles. His father is the publisher of the "Age". I am glad to know that Billy Coleman is coming away, & I will not be surprised if George enlists as well. Let me tell them that there is plenty of room for them, so don't be bashful, & let them bring along a few more with them. I must say that admitting we are in a warlike country & the noise indicates anything but peace, but I must confess that the sunsets we see here, surpass anything of the kind in Australian & whilst I am writing this, there is a most glorious scene out by Imbros & all the boys are watching it.
In commencing this page, I want you to understand that it is being written on the next night to that of the previous pages written, as I find it difficult to write during the daytime, & a little more news available. Early this morning, the Turks concentrated their Artillery & opened fire on our positions at daybreak, & things were lively for some little time. A six inch shell struck our gun pit & came in & burst. There were 3 gunners sleeping inside when it burst, & of course were rudely awakened; Strange to say not one of them was injured, altho' they suffered somewhat from shock & a little temporary deafness, which will soon pass off. Considering the size of the shell, it is simply miraculous how any of the three escaped with their lives, but wonders will never cease. All kinds of shell came over, & from all directions, & it had us thinking which side of the trench to sit, but there is always a "Wag" in the crowd who has something dead funny to say & this keeps the crowd merry. He inferred that "somebody should get a Solicitors letter" over all this shelling. Well, Mother, I think I have come to the end of this epistle so will draw to a conclusion, assuring you all that I am in the very best of health & spirits & that we will soon drive the Turks out of the Peninsular & then we will go on to Germany & "mop" up the Kaiser. I hope you are all well & I want you not to worry about me so with the best of love to all at home, Believe me to be Your affectionate Son Norman.
