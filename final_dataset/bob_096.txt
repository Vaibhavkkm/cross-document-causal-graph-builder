My dear Mum, Still here and feeling tip top again leg just a little sore and stiff but nothing to write home about expect to be quite all right again in a couple of days Shall leave here about next Thursday and rejoin the Battn who are now out of the  line for a month I believe they are at a place almost 12 miles from here hope to get there in a car from here Am having a splendid loaf do some reading, swimming, bridge an occasional trip to Hazebrouck which is not a bad town. Then the food is excellent here 4 course dinner at night Burgundy and  port wine to boot so that every thing in the garden is lovely. We are having quite Australian weather hot as the devil for all the world like February in Sydney you know only too well what that is like Some of the English officers here feel it muchly. Expect there must be  some mail for me somewhere have not had  any for some time. Shall be glad to receive it lots of love to all, Bob.
