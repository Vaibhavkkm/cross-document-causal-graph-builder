We got our mail tonight, and everybody is happy and good-natured as is always
the case when the mail comes. I received your letters #8 and #9, also Howard’s and
Emily’s. I received three letters from Ottawa, also one from Mr. Reed. I will try to
answer Emily’s later on. I have not had time to re-read all the letters, and the clippings
will be saved ‘till tomorrow. I appreciate all of the news and agree that it is better to send
clippings than whole newspapers. I won’t attempt to answer your letters now as I like to
re-read them during the week and write a little from time to time.
Don’t you think that it would be better not to publish even extracts from my
letters in the “Pantagraph?” I don’t think they can be of much general interest, and I
write them only for you and Dad and the folks at home – and the censor (I almost forgot
about him.)
I have a little bulletin board in our billet for company orders, etc. I tacked up two
of the cartoons I received tonight so all the boys could see them. The two I selected were
entitled, “When a Fellow Needs a Friend” and “Swivillian Heroes in Washington.” They
made quite a hit with the boys.
Mr. Reed wrote me quite an interesting and patriotic letter, lamenting that he
could not serve more actively than by buying bonds, etc. His letter happened to end in
the middle of a typewritten sheet, and the stenographer, Miss Johnson at the Chicago
office, could not resist the temptation to finish out the page with a little note of her own,
which I thought was a very thoughtful thing for her to do. I don’t think Mr. Reed could
object, either, as she was Hooverizing on white paper.
` I like to hear from Howard and hope he will find time to write again. Will close
now, with much love to all.
