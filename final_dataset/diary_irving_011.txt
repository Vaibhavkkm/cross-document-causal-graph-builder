Weather: cold, windstorm, sandladen Health: good
Up at 6:00. Reveille 6:15. Breakfast, liver, onions, oatmeal, coffee. Make cot. Wash. Rosenbaum reported to have returned only to run away again. Signal practice in Recreation Room. Sgt. Curry. He becomes facetious. Told about good old summer times and exemption with flags. Read the “American Printer,” a magazine I never had time to read in the City. Rifle practice inside with Holliwell targets. Quite proficient. Signal practice. A walk in the wind, braving the sand. Lieut. McMurtry follows a course that is free from blowing sand, but eyes, ears and nose are full. Must wash on return. Dinner, pork and beans, turnips, coffee. We notice a change in meals since civilian cook left us. Mess kits to be inspected. Manual of arms inside. I find that gun is not so heavy as at first. Guns away. An air of secrecy about officers. Suddenly, fire drill announced. I run with hose cart to Fifth Avenue and back to barracks. Delightful run without overcoat. Enjoyable, because I did not run in labored manner which incidentally surprises me. Read. We sing songs or rather practice singing in Mess Hall. I suggest letting me go to shop so I might print songs in book form. Reconsider because passes will be greatly restricted on account of coal situation on LIRR. A letter from Leah. Full of troubles in shop. Supper, roast beef, potatoes, stewed pears and peaches. Write. Go with Sam to see Friedman. See bakers at work. Go to K of C Hall. Telephone Leah. She is very cheerful. Conditions in shop much better. See basketball game. Back to barracks. Discover I have lost leggings. Make bed, shave and wash leggings. Have shoes shined. To bed at 10:00. Do not rest well. Sand has hurt my nose and throat.
