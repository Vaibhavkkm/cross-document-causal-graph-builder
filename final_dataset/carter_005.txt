Mena Camp,
31/1/1915. Dear Father & Mother,  There is a crowd of men being sent back to Australia next week - they consist of two lots - those found medically unfit, & wasters - the former in the majority. I recommended two wasters from my old Co to go back & both are going - -  I went up to see Freff (Sister U. M. Carter.) yesterday – She looks as well & happy as can be. We fixed up a very nice donkey ride excursion in the evening which was just great. Freff supplied two other nurses & I supplied 2 other officers. It was a perfect night - full moon - - - We went round the Sphinx. the old thing was made to smile for us by the Arabs. This is done by turning a piece of magnesium wire close up under the head & the shadow thrown up makes the Sphinx appear to smile,
