Text:  Dearest Mother and all at Home & Relations Elsewhere. I have just received your letters from yourself & Mab & have read them through about 48 times, I can't describe the feeling it sent through me to get them either We can only feel sorry for those who don't get letters & they walk away very disappointed & "Crack hardy", Well I am very grateful for the letters & am very sorry to think that I can't write to everybody I would like to, but hope you will let everybody know that I am as busy as a Sergeant of the Artillery can only be. What with stables & Gun Drill & signalling & all kinds of Riding & Driving Drill getting ready for Kaiser Bill & Co, time is very scarce for writing letters & Home must be first. We are quite settled down in camp now & there must be 20,000 troops here now & they are all getting into shape rapidly. We get plenty to eat & drink & also plenty of clean clothes. The natives do all the dirty work & we live like lords of the Desert. The Arabs of the Desert have magnificent ponies & the Officers & trying to get hold of some. We have fine big tents which are double & let a passage of air all around & even in the hottest time of the day, the tents are beautifully cold.

You will be pleased to know that all the boys are in the best of health & send their best wishes to everybody  including Floss Robinson, who they can never forget. I am in the best of health & am positive that I have never felt better in my life & cannot expect to I am as frisky as a horse & am rapidly losing my "bingy" as I can take up my belt to the fifth hole, whilst it was only the second hole at B'meadows Don't laugh now please, we got orders that no man is to shave his upper lip (Oh my) Fancy me with [[7?]] hairs under my nose (What oh). Cairo is still the same wicked place & I don't go in very much of a night (about once a week & am back in camp by 11 pm.) We are hiring a motor car to take 7 of us Sergeants all around the place to- morrow (Sunday) afternoon to see everything we can. This afternoon, we went to the Pyramids & went to the top of one. Oh my word, Mum, talk about climing stairs, stairs 4 feet high & the Pyramid was 470 feet high, I was thinking of you when I was half way up. It takes 20 minutes to climb it, going all the time, & when we got to the top, what a sight we saw, it was well worth it, as the sight was one we will never forget. Towards 
Cairo, it was lovely & green & all cultivated & the rivers & canals all running through the Arabs villages was something beautiful & wonderful. On the other side was the Desert & the whole of an under- ground city that is being unearthed by an English Syndicate & this goes to prove the mysteries of a people who lived years o before Christ, all the place is buried completely by the sand of the Great Sahara Desert, & about the sand is sea shells & yet we are hundreds of miles from the Sea, on the other side we had a splendid view of the Camp & it was a magnificent sight & the moving troops bd looked like ants crawling along. We could see an Arab funeral & burial from where we were. They make a holiday of it, & all the men & women from miles around attend & the service last about 4 hours. The women all keep up a peculiar wailing all the time On top of the Pyramid I carved the following names. M. Ellsworth. Mab Ellsworth, Flos Robinson, Rupert Ellsworth, Jack Tilton, Ruby Davidson, Alice Butler, Nellie Wheeler, & a couple of others. So you can tell your friends that your names are on the top of the Pyramid of "Cheops" which is the tomb of Ramesis & some Ancient King & Queen. We went in side & it is simply marvellous, the outside stones are only a covering to some of the most wonderful stone dressed by human hands. First, we had to take off our boots, because the floor is slanting & is of beautiful transparent Alabastine & is smoother than marble, & we had to stoop going through the underground passages & our guide told us all the news & a few lies chucked in. We saw the actual place where Ramesis was laid & other Mummies, who have been removed to Museums. The walls of the vaults were of marble & Granite & each piece was over 16 feet long & 8 feet thick & 8 feet high & how they were got into positions are only to make one wonder the more. The ceiling also was of massive granite pieces, beautifully dressed & goes to prove that the people who built these Pyramids were cleverer than the people who live now-adays. Our Guide had a fight with another guide over the tomb of Ramesis. The fact is each guide was trying to talk the loudest & because our Chap won (he looked like the Caliph) the other spat at him, so our sport sailed into him & gave him two lovely right swings on to his jaw & then clutched him by the throat & nearly 
throttled him & it was only by our persuasions that he desisted. In the midst of the fight, which was conducted in candle light, Harry Braithwaite disappeared with a fearful howl into a hole in the floor about 3 feet deep. Of course he didn't know this, & thought that he was falling into the bowels of the Earth, however Braiths was soon pulled out & set on his feet again to his great relief. The tomb is divided off into two sections. One for the Kings & one for the Queens. The branches & passages run in all directions & some go up & some go down, but no matter where one goes, it is all wonderful. I will tell you the fuller details when I come home. The Proclamation was read yesterday, but there was no military display, & the population took things very quietly & beyond a few Union Jacks, there was no demonstrations what ever, altho' the people are pleased that the British are over them. Well Mother dear, I must now close as it is bed time. I do hope you are well & all at home & Charles & Ettie & family, George, Aunts & Uncles & Cousins, Jack Tilton, Rupert, Mab & Floss & "Gillie" & everybody, to make a long story short. Best love to yourself & all at home & Miss Taylor, from your loving son, Norman. (write soon) 
Tell Rupert that the little donkeys are bonzer to ride on / I've bought a watch from Cairo for 16/- & it is a beauty. George I'm in love with Soldiering   I hope you get the money alright & without any trouble. I have tons of money & get paid weekly. Please write & tell me if you want some & I'll send it to you straight away. When we go into town we dine at "Shepherds" which is the Menzies & the come home in a Car .


I have met several old Christ Church Choir Boys who are in different Forces
