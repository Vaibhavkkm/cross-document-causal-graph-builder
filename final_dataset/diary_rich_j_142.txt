November 29th.  Wednesday. I learnt this morning first by the congratulations of the fellows and then by enquiring at the orderly room that my commission has gone through and dates from November 25th. But why I have not been called upon to go with the battalion rather worries me very much but then it is their own lookout and I expect they will know better than to give me work to do that I don't understand. I hope, however, that the delay means going to a school which is almost more than I can expect. Some fellows got three months schooling in England however!! I have not been away from the camp today. I went to have a hot shower bath and had the fact brought once again before me that the military authorities, for installing such water heaters, display deplorable weak knowledge. They are in no way satisfactory; they burn up quantities of coal in the four fires and then the water is all at the one temperature and no cold water is obtainable to mix with it and to break it down, so much so that steam is often flying from the shower and the men have to stand back and wait until it is run off and cools down; there is no means of regulating the thing at all. A most unsatisfactory and wasteful business and the British are still erecting this type of concern.
