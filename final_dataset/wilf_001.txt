 S.S. Karoola.  June 16th. 1915.   My dear mother, Cannot get any paper on which to write you so am using an envelope. We have just come aboard, Harry came down with me to see me off by the midnight train. Eight officers & 616 men are also going with us in addition to our 9 medicos & 25 nurses & we are to pick up more nurses at Freemantle. I told Harry we were probably calling at Melbourne but that is not so, but Freemantle is the 1st port of call & I don't know where afterwards. The Karoola is a very nice about about 7000 tons 
& we have nice cabins with two men in each. Wesley is with me & Graham just opposite with Parkinson. We have nice smoking & sitting rooms & a small hospital with about twenty beds in it We may not leave today, if we do not I will write you more when I have time - I want to give this to someone to post. I've just heard that we may leave shortly however. We came over here in two ferry boats from Fort Macquarie  in the midst of great cheering. All our baggage has come over - I bought a deck chair fortunately. We are all very cheerful, my only worry is as to how you feel & do hope that you are quite chirpy. So goodbye for the present my dear with best love to all from Wilf. [* P.S. Please let Harry know about port of call.*]
