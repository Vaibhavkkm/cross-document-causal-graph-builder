Just a line to let you know I am at the   Front - this is my second day in the Trenches. I can't write much - but I can't realise   how our boys effected a landing. It was a   simply marvellous feat. I am posted to C Co. - under Capt. Shaw. You   can imagine my joy in meeting Cornish & Giles   especially as they had been 'Killed' - it shows how little credit one must give to 'rumors'. My Co. are mostly Broken Hill men - our trench is called "Sulphide St," Oxide, &c. - Our men, all Australians, are well dug in, and will take a great deal to shift us. Dug outs and trenches are not bad in fine weather - but when the wet sets in - things will be very different.. We are constantly under fire night & day - but are so well dug in that we suffer little loss - we lose most when out patrolling - or from 'snipers' who play the very devil with us. I have already had some close shaves, & one's hair rises now & then to hear 'ping - thud - just above one's head in the bushes up top.  64 shells were lobbed in a small space in 4½ minutes a day ago, & not one of our chaps was hurt. We have bully beef & dog biscuits, but we are cheerful & await the orders to 'advance', I've lost the habit already of ducking when shell or shrapnel metal burst just overhead.
