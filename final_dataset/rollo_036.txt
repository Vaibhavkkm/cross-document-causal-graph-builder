 Our new position is on the highest point of 7  Anzac position - & Jacko reminds us of this  rather too often. Their shrapnel is by no  means any less - but far more plentiful - but  manage to dodge it somehow.  Your letters are astray somewhere. I got a B.  June 3rd. Wumps letter May 23 - letter from you  May 18 & April 25 - (last one went somewhere  out of my ken) - and 3 Leaders. I suppose the  others will come in a rush - Thanks for papers  tip-top - Must stop now - as I must write  to Carthew - ( heard from him last mail) - so  close with much love - & hope you're as well as I am.
