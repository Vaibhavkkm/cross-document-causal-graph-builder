THE OLD. THE NEW.  
The Mercantile Rowing Club is making a new departure in S.A. Rowing in holding combined Scratch Eights. Members  of all clubs have been asked to participate and the response has been more than gratifying.  The proceeds from the entrance fees will augment the Building Fund to the extent of ₤8.
The present shed was built 25 years ago and it is superfluous to say it needs replacing.  Plans have been prepared  for a two storey jarrah structure with a flat roof for viewing  the races ; the cost will be ₤750.  Rowing is an expensive  sport and an additional drawback is the absence of any outside  help in the shape of gate money.  The upkeep of the  boathouse and boats takes every penny of the 60 odd  members' subscriptions of 30/- each.  As each member has  to pay for all entrance fees, training expenses, etc., to  increase the subscription would cause a lot of the members to  drop out.  We cannot charge you for admission to view  races, but if you would care to add a little to the ₤Ioo we  have already collected from members only, kindly fill in the  form below and give it to any member.
 MERCANTILE ROWING CLUB. NEW BOAT HOUSE. To the Hon. Secy., Boat House Committee. Dear Sir, Enclosed please find donation to your  Building Fund. Yours faithfully,
