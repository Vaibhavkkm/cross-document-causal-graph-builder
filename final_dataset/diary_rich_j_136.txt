November 23rd.  Thursday. We are preparing to move off again. At a grand parade of the transport section today all was in good order and ready to leave. I am intent on writing tonight if only to fix up a reply to Angus Ferguson and a line to Bert. Bill's letter today was very pleasing. The three houses acquired for £l,050 seems a bargain right enough and if the world settles down to its normal footing shortly these should be worth money or at any rate a jolly good living for the old folk. Even if the war continues South African mining fields are hardly likely to suffer as gold must be won to carry - 25 - on our end of the war; that being so, Johannesburg should not go back. At the same time I wish that we owned the same property in Sydney. There it would be more valuable and for the old folk more congenial. Today has been the best and brightest day we've had for a long time. I washed three woollen shirts, but owing to the darkness falling at A o'clock they had not time to dry. Our bearer division has gone road making to fill up their spell from the trenches. This is better than lounging around and will do them more good than parades, route marches and drilling, much as they may squeak about it. Anyhow, they will squeak and grumble at anything, so it doesn't much matter.
