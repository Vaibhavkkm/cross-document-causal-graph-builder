 Dear Min  Just a few lines to let you know that I am quite well  and I hope you are also quite well. I received your welcome letter yesterday and  was glad to hear from you and to know that you are alright it is the first  letter I have received from you while in the trenches I had one from Bob  a few day ago he was quite well at the time of writing he is now somewhere  in France Mother says in her letter she is sorry for the boys going to  france as they will feel the cold she is quite forgetting that the boys  including myself felt the heat while in Egypt and also the sand  and was really dying a slow but sure death by staying there and  I think that every one of us are glad to leave Egypt to the niggers  and chance the cold weather of France we have very long days here  it is still light at 10PM and gets light before 3 oclock in the morning  so we do not have many hours of darkness I would not like  to work for a cocky over here if they were anything like the South  coasters start before and finish at dark a fellow would have  a pretty rough time of it Dear Min Regus was pretty diff  being sent up to Dubbo from Sydney some of the late  reinforcements that came over to Egypt were very stiff  when they arrived they were sent to a camp out on the  desert away from Cairo so all they seen of Egypt was the  sand of the desert and the niggers and they are not 
worth looking at greasy dirty looking beggars the  women of the well to do lot look alright but you can  only see their eyes as they wear a veil so what is the  good of that anyhow it is good to be out of it and france  will do me although a fellow stands a chance of getting hurt  with lead and iron rations flying about Dear Min if  ever I get to the old dart I will go to places that you  mention in your letter and make inquiries and find out  as much as I can Dear Min I started writing to Mother  last night while I was writing there were shells flying around  now as I am writing to you there are some more flying round  and when I am writing to Flo there will be some more so you will  all be able to say that when this letter was handwritten there  was lead and iron flying about over in france Dear Min  I have no more news this time so I will close with best  love I remain  Your Loving Brother  Stephen  Dear Min  I am enclosing a poppy flower which I got  growing in one of the saps  Steve
