Text:  The Brigadier complimented me about the condition of my trenches - & that suits me better than getting a couple of M.C. A small mail just came in, bringing two splendid parcels, for me, one from you - the other from Boltons. Thanks for them - & also for the cabled birthday greetings.  We have just my birthday dinner in the celebrated Delville Wood - soup - currant jelly, curried bully beef stew, plum pudding, & crystallised fruit to top-off.  Supper tonight will have cocoa and shortbread, while the chocolate supply will keep us going for a day or two yet - so you can see I’ve had a most famous feast.  Boltons sent on some chocs & shortbread - a fine body-belt knitted by Cis, & a warm pair of gloves.  I’ll write to them as soon as I finish this. You must pardon this short note - but take ‘no news’ as ‘good news’ & things as O.K. I will write again in about a week’s time - & hope to be “back in France” as I am now, at that time. I will close with all good wishes for good fortune, health, &c - & much love to you all from Rollo I am in tip-top health.
