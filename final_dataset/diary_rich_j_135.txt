November 22nd.  Wednesday. It was a heavy misty morning but at midday a smothered sun appeared. At 2 o'clock I mounted "John Gilpin", Ned Reynolds on "Old Tom" and off we went to Heilly, a decent village 6 kilos away. There the sun shone strongly and I enjoyed the exhilaration of riding over the springy turf fields, moreso as "John" is a good trotter and can jump cleanly over gutters and holes. At night I waited with three other chaps in a double line for the second house at the picture show but the place was full before our turn to enter came so we had a pint of cold beer and some biscuits, and with cold feet wandered back to the canvas home between the shafts of "Windy's" cart. It was necessary to light the fire, so to get wood a post was removed from the road side and it warmed us up some. At present I have a lovely camp stretcher to sleep on and about six blankets, yet I cover up my head each night and find my feet cold very often. What I will do when in the line with one or no blankets at all, is causing me a little worry even now.
