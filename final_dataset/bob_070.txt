 My dear Lorna, Received Two letters from you yesterday dated about the 4th & 10th Dec. respectively you are a perfect dear to write considering you only hear from me once in a blue moon however know you see the home letters and get all the news. Wrote to Jane this morning from the hospital so expect you will get the same old 2s/2d dished up to you but having half an hour to spare thought I would write you a letter all to yourself becoming very sweet all of a sudden don't you think put it down to the weather it is s snowing like the devil outside am tickled to death walking about in it most fascinating I think Have been lunching to-day with a Mrs Hill  she has 2 sons in Australia working a sheep station at Moree although she has never been out there is of course very interested. There were 4 of us lunching & 4 ladies very swank to plenty of nice things to eat and drink and the house a perfect mansion this certainly is the place for fine homes we simply having nothing like it in Australia beautiful large rooms exquisite old pictures furniture and china. The funny thing about them all to me is that from the outside you would pass them by as being very ordinary but they certainly are very comfortable and beautiful inside After lunch they wanted us to go in their motor with them to Wimberley to put the afternoon in skating unfortunately I had to get back to town to keep an appointment at 4 o'clock so could not go plenty of skating in and about London at present coming back to town walked through the  Park the Serpentine is frozen  hard about 6" thick there  were many people skating of course you will know this beautiful stretch of water in Hyde Park so you will know what a gorgeous skating ground it is f all frozen hard it is also a wonderful sight about a fortnight ago boats were being rowed about on it birds swimming in it  and now you could drive a bus across it Told Jane about all my social engagements lately have been going the pace luncheons dances  etc with all  the blooming heads of the city a truly wonderful experience for me to meet these people go to their magnificent homes 4/2/17 etc  all this would simply be impossible as a tourist in this country in peace time Have a special invitation for the opening of the House of Lords next Wednesday am looking forward to it  it should be most interesting and instructive. Am still in hospital just fancy that 5 whole months who would have thought it expect to  get out this month some time for sure so that will give me plenty of time to be in France for the next big offensive of course I am quite all right now perhaps a shade weak and a little wasted in the right leg if that were possible however another months rest should  fix me for heavy work again Say old girl what a shame if a fellow goes back to France and gets  slugged after seeing, doing, and  learning so much in the past 18 months or so I shall be most annoyed. Am still having a wonderful time in London experiences of all descriptions some of  course which one could not  mention it is all very interesting and fascinating and believe me kid I have learnt a few things right here in this town and although it costs a lot of money think it is not wasted in the long run Well old thing bye - bye for the present lots of love to yourself Jack and the kid Trust one may be back home to see you all by next Xmas if lucky from brother Bobbie.
