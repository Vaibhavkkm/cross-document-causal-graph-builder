France, 15/5/16.
Dearest Mother & Father, 
There has been "nothing startling" since 
I wrote last week. There have not been any 
letters from Australia during the past 
week, and I am feeling the want of them
a bit.
I saw Mr. Heathcote yesterday and
he showed me a letter from Perce dated 
7/3/16 giving him all the news from school.
Perce mentions, inter alia, that he had just 
written to me, but this also is "on the way".
Tell Perce he Norman is well and was very pleased 
to get his letter. Jimmy Haddow got a 
commission in Egypt and is now with the
58th Battalion. One of the other chaps who used 
to be in the tent at Albert Park (he is now
a Warrant Officer) was asking if he had seen 
Perce.  Norman Heathcote said, "Don't you
remember the little boy who used to bring
over the hot scones and apple tarts." "My word
I do", said Bromilow, "and I wish we had a 
few of them now. That was in the good old 
days". Then followed a eulogy of the apple
tarts and of mother's good cooking.  There is really not much to write about
until I get a few letters from you. I have
not had any letter from Les. since I last
wrote, but I have another from Dr. Gibson.
he says that he wrote to you telling you
how Les. was getting on. I suppose you
were comforted a bit by it. He is a very
jolly chap indeed, and his letters cheer
me up considerably.
The weather has not been so fine lately
and it is said that the month of May
is usually showery in northern France.
We do not know when we will move out
of this Camp, but it should not be long now.
We hear all sorts of rumours about the fighting,
but it seems to me that the closer one is, the
less chance you have of hearing anything reliable.
I have sent a good few postcards the
last couple of mails and hope they "landed"
safely.
Hoping to hear of you shortly,
Your affectionate son,
Jim.
