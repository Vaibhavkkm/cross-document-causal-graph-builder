Shells are  pretty thick & hot - but I hope to keep out of their  way - & also to miss any loose bits.  The men are all well, - fit & ready all waiting  for the " Op-Aht -an-at-em - Boys" order, which may  come at any time now.  No news - but we've good news - I will have lots  to speak about when I get home.  I am trusting to God to help me through O.K.  Know my boys will be successful in whatever  job they're set to do.  I will close now with very best wishes for  health, success, & prosperity to you all - and  very much love from your loving son,  Rollo.
