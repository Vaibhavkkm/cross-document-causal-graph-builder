Monday Sept 28th We went down to the "Class Macorkaddle" to day and bought away our 102 horses, and walked them back to camp / 1 hours 40 minutes/ one man per horse These horses were only put on board last Friday and there must be some considerable delay for the  authorities to do this. There are  a hundred roumorors as to the cause But rumours are as plentiful as they are unreasonable these times. I intended going peacefully to bed to-night but discovered I had  picket duty to do from 6.30 to 11. which time hung heavily indeed
