 Reported at Base Mustapha & received same reply "Report at 9.30 tomorrow" I met Capt Greig & we went to the Metropole record office. I got some papers from O.R.S. to take over. We went down to the docks. had a look in shed 20 to see if there were any letters. Was told that there would be some in tomorrow. Found out that the [[Barnfaro?]] Castle was going to Gallipoli to day. Strange that we cannot get away yet? Went out to Moharem Bay in the afternoon to a pigeon match didn't feel too well so only shot in two or three sweeps. Met two of my old Transport men. Wignell L & Jones & we had dinner together at Grand Palace Hotel. I missed Frank tonight he could not come in as Kong Meng is in hospital I went into a Jewish Synagogue where music was being played I watched the band. The master & players & instruments interested me. Am off to bed early
