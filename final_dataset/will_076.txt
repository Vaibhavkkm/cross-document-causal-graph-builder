PRIVATE. 27th March, 1917.   My dear General, Thank you so much for your letter. It is all most interesting. By this time of course you have made a much greater advance and are far beyond where I left your troops. I am glad to hear that your men are in such good spirits and that they have once again proved themselves indomitable, and I hope with all my heart that greater triumphs may await them in the near future. I am being pressed about the inability to inflict the death sentence. I have been in communication  w1th the Australian Government but they decline to take action, and I don't think it is possible to press Mr. Hughes on this subject at a moment when he is engaged in a desperate political struggle. I am very sorry to hear that difficulties exist in connection  with this matter, and can only assure you that I have done what I can and am afraid it is impossible to do more. Thank you so much for your kindly invitation to come and stay with you again, which I shall be very glad to do if I have the opportunity, but I don’t see much prospect of it as it is almost impossible to get away even for a day. Sincerely Yours, Walter H Long
