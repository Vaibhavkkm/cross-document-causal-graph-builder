through the usual tour. Most of the tombs were   sand bagged, most of the important treasures had   been removed to safer places - as Zep raids are  very real here.  I spent the afternoon about Whitehall - Parliament   House, War Office, [[?]], Horse Guards etc  This morning I did the "Tower" enjoying myself   very much. The "Beefeater" who showed me round   was very thorough, & my history was well brushed   up. This afternoon I intend to go to St. Paul's, -   tomorrow visit Wandsworth & Epsom Hospitals as   several of my boys are there & I must see them.  I found out Horseferry Road where Scott is. I   was pleased to hear he was doing fairly well &   I hope to see him personally.     I am afraid I must ditch Scotland this trip,  time is all too short and there is so much of   interest to see. As I must be back here by the   27th Liverpool & Environs will keep me busy till   then.  I will close now for time being, with very  very much love, & best of all good wishes from  Rollo.
