Author: Robert James Henderson Date: 30. 3. 1917.  My dear Mum, By the above address you will see I am back in France quite temporary this time though am leaving here this afternoon for England again having had a trip across on duty. Left Perham Downs (Tidworth) last Tuesday at 6.30 PM with a draft of 90 men for our base in France Etaples and  am now on my return to Perham where I have to report again on the completion of duty.  Hope to reach London tonight some time where I shall stay until Sunday night The trip has been great for me having stayed in and seen around new places such
as Folkestone Boulogne Etaples etc. Have just had a walk around Boulogne it appears to be a dirty hole and not particularly interesting it seems quite funny being in France again after such a long spell among English people Saw Jack Kirkwood at Etaples where he is waiting to be sent back to his battalion he is very well again and looks splendid Am not too good myself at present my mouth still giving me a lot of trouble shall have to go and see the doctor on my return I must get this trouble fixed up Have you heard from Nana wonder how he is getting on have had no word from him for quite a long time shall drop you a line when in London again lots of love to all, Boby.
