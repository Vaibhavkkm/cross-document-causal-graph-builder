France  26/6/1916     Dearest of Mothers  I received your  letter of the 21st inst last  night.  So glad you like   my pall Win Charter. But why  accuse him of being an  Annanias?  Don't you really   think a decent boy enjoys  a few hours in a real   home after being away for   12 months roughing it?  Hope Dad had a good  time showing them about London  Giddy old Days.  I hope your prognostication  re end of war is correct.  I hope Ernie R has not
