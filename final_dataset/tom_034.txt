Cortoon 4th November, 1914  My dear Tom We were delighted to get news of you Monday. It seemed so long since we had heard. Yes no doubt you will find the journey monotonous, there is comfort in the knowledge that the food is good & wholesome. No doubt the trip will be beneficial to health & fit you for future work. You were fortunate in getting away when you did for we have had most shocking dust storms, wind & heat. I pity the troops in camp. Eileen is very well, though we can see where her thoughts are I am sure she is trying to keep bright, no doubt she will give you all news of herself Tom [[Boydell?]] has had a severe attack of influenza away from the Office over a week so you can guess he was ill Dr. Mussell said he should have given in before however he returned  to work yesterday & he will soon be strong again.  Arthur Burns 
has enlisted. He is in the Light Horse. Went into camp last Friday. I think  Gay Burns will go with next contingent.  Freda, Linda & Molly have gone to town [Fat Anna?] still airs her pro  German views She & W.. Champion had a wordy war last Friday She  has not been here since. I know  you will have [[many?]] to write to Tom so  do not think I [[will?]] be vexed at your  not writing me. We miss you very much, especially Saturdays & Sundays. Leo, Lin, Eileen & I went to Mitcham Sunday afternoon. Lin & Eileen went to see Vera Maughn Saturday, poor girl is very ill. She was so glad to see the girls. You will be in our thoughts at Christmas time. Now dear I must away & see to dinner much love from Mother
