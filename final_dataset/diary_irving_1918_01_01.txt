Weather: cold Health: my cold is about the same
Up at 11. We are very lazy. I take a bath with my wrist watch on. Another cold sore makes its appearance. A big breakfast. Read Times and am pleased with peace outlook. Bertha brings me cake. It is very cold in house. Running short of coal. Leah makes cake and candy for me to bring back to camp, while I criticize. Take another nap. Dinner which was made especially for me it seems. Dolly calls up and I promise to visit her. After dinner another nap. Apter calls while I am asleep. I play fox. Wake up as he is about to leave. We chat a little. Go to Dolly’s and do a few errands. Get back at seven thirty. For the last three hours have been watching with consternation the hours slip by. The last half days of my furloughs aren’t happy ones on that account. Supper cold. Water pipes burst in the cellar. Work on books. Give Leah instructions and admonish her on conduct of business. Lie on sofa for an hour with my sweetheart, a very tearful one and silent, seated beside me. Crying cannot be quelled. Makes it doubly hard for me to go back. Bag packed by Leah, while I am at Dolly’s and my clothes are ready and I go away at 11:30. Poor Leah. So many tears. So many mutual blessings. Atlantic Avenue on time. Meet Sam and Margaret, other boys. Train makes good time to Jamaica. 1:00 out of Jamaica. Get seats in heated cars. Comfortable seats. Read Zangwill and smoke. Heat becomes oppressive. Drowsy, take fitful nap. Train makes long stop. Fast for a while, then another stop. Remove rubbers and overcoat. Perspire freely. Dry-mouthed. Body aching from strained position. Boys do not get up to give officers seats. Democratic with a vengeance. Train gets in at 5:15. Either too hot or too cold on the L.I. Railroad. No happy medium it seems.
