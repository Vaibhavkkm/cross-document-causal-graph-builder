Weather: cold, clear Health: good, best night since arrival
Up at 6:00. Reveille at 6:15. Breakfast 6:30. Oatmeal, steak, coffee. Rosenbaum and Henchwiser absent from Reveille. Other boys depart for South at 6:45. Company inspection at 7:30. Everybody camouflages shaves. Outside with rifles. Back to barracks for signal drill, bomb-throwing. Circulars and pledge blanks given out to be mailed to friends for contributions to Community Hall Fund. I send five, one to Leah. I am called to Orderly Room. Frightened. Asked to get another affidavit to complete my case. Go back to drill class. Called again. Much more frightened. Asked to keep all my papers until complete. Fire alarm sounds. A small fire, Company A. Out in sweaters, some no hats. Dinner, soup, boiled beef, horseradish sauce, stewed corn, potatoes, coffee. Foot inspection announced. Read paper. 3 of our boys go to new training school. See Graumy’s name too. Doctor tells me my left foot is flat. We go for hike up football field. Fine. Read. Wait impatiently for retreat. Fear more men will be called to go South and naturally am worried about myself. Ask for leave or pass for Saturday and Sunday. Retreat. Drill. Supper, macaroni, prunes, coffee. Write, read. Clean gun. Go with Sam to see Friedman. I see a Post Office where Sam breaks a five dollar bill and receives change for dollar only. Back to barracks. Read. Get a package from Dolly. Mark comes with another, but I refuse it. Give him some candy instead. Promise to visit him Monday. Rest in bed till lights out. Say prayers. Kiss Leah and do not sleep. Noise all night. Reilly, fireman, makes too much noise. Curley and Curry take a swig from bottle. Boys talk in sleep.
