Author: Robert James Henderson Date: 25. 3. 1917.  My dear Mum, Am at this place where I arrived last Monday waiting to be sent overseas again and believe me it is the limit as cold as the devil rain and snow all the week mud up to your knees you can imagine my feelings getting into a hard wooden bed on the bare floor of a wooden hut with no fires between blankets after over six months sleeping between sheets on soft beds and comfortable quarters hospital hotels etc etc I have not had a decent sleep here yet and both my hips are darned sore however expect one will get used to it shortly We have nothing much to do here except having to be on parade each day 9 to 12 & 2 to 4 but they have special instructors for everything so we just hang around and freeze Do not know how long I shall be here may be 2 days or 4 weeks depends on transports etc Am
hoping I shall not have to take a draft of men across if not shall get 48 hours in London going back which will be better than nothing leave here is out of the question so that everyone is hoping to get away as soon as possible. We are about 2 miles from Tidworth the nearest bit of a town it is a one horse show went to the theatre there last night Jack the beanstalk of course very rotten think I shall go dippy if stuck in this hole for long no where to go nothing to do except get tight every day. however shall just have to trust to luck. A large draft left here yesterday about 22 officers among them Doss Wallack of the 13th Browning is down here with me expect we shall go back together We have officers 
from all units here men who have been wounded sick etc all ready for G.S. again and waiting to be sent back to join up their respective units.  Am feeling only pretty fair my mouth is still giving me a deal of trouble sore and bleeding gums etc which is very uncomfortable this damp and wet weather does not improve matters expect to get quite fit again when back in France with the Battn and get some work which interests me again There is absolutely no news here stuck in a cold bleak plain think I have told you all about the grand time I have had in London the trouble is the contrast is too great here and one felt feels it terribly lots of love to all, Boby
