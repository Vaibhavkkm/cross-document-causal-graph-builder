  No 18 Stationary Hospital  
October 30th 1915     Dearest Mother & all at Home,  Just a line to let you  know that altho' I am still in  Hospital, nevertheless  I am doing  famously & feeling great, & am very  pleased to tell you that the Dr  has put my name down for a  trip to either England or elsewhere.  He wants to try & get me to  England, but I believe Australians  & New Zealanders have some  difficulty in getting past Alexandria owing to some rivalry between  the Australian Authorities & the  Imperial Authorities, & this may  possibly block me from a nice little  trip to the old Country, nevertheless  the Dr Is doing his best for me   to get to England, and both he &  the nurse have been telling me  of the different places of interest  that I should see, & what bus to  take & all that sort of thing, so  you see they are awfully nice  to me. The Dr (Scott) is a young  American & has the real Yankee 
drawl, & when he comes into our  ward of a morning, he looks at  me & says "Waal Sargeant, I  didn't see ye in Piccadilly Circus  this marning" & things like  that, so I'm a moral for a   trip somewhere. He has just  felt my pulse & said "Yaas  you're alright for Leister Squarre"  Sister Fletcher, in charge of  our Ward, I cannot speak too  highly of; Her efforts & energy  are wonderful & untiring. She  is, of course, an English girl,  as all the nurses & orderlies  are; the latter are all men  of course & do all the dirty  work. Most of the patients  are Tommies & don't seem to  mind how much work they  put the nurse & orderlies to.  The nurse told me that she  would rather nurse 10 of  the Australians or New Zealanders,  than 5 tommies as we  don't give nearly the trouble. 
The Dr has just come & told me  that the big "Mauretania is  expected in in a day or two, &  that she was there at Alexandria picking up some patients  there & was then coming here  & after filling up here, would   go direct to England, so my  chances look rosy.  I am on soft diet such as  Boiled Eggs, Arrowroot, Boiled  Chicken, & Bread, butter & honey  & tea & milk, sodawater, etc.  & a bottle of stout everyday,  but I have signed the pledge  again & usually give my stout  to our Orderly, who is a splendid  chap & can't do enough for  me. I will be able to draw  some money when I get to   England, but the Dr told me  that we get motor trips & buss  rides, & admission to the theatres & music halls for "nix"  & others at ¼price. I must go  out to Gravesend to see your  people & I also want to attend  a service in St Pauls Cathedral,  London if possible & the Dr told  me to be sure to visit Westminster Abbey & to see the  Crown Jewels & all that sort of  thing. He even told me to be  sure & get on bus number 88  at Nelsons Monument & for 2'  you can travel along the most  interesting route in London, & told  me of all the places I would  see, such as the War Office,  Horse Guards, Hyde Park & all  those kinds of places, so if the  Zeppelins are good enough  to keep out whilst Im there,   I should have a good time.  I have also just heard  some cheering news that the  Germans have threatened to torpoedo the Mauretania,  but I don't mind so long as  I get on board of her, I'll  chance all the Submarines.  They have been fairly active  around here lately & give   our Torpoedo boat destroyers  plenty of work escorting  troopships & storeships into  this harbour. It is very  interesting to watch these little  boats escorting a battleship  or transport about. They go  at a tremendous speed &  cut across the front of the   other boats bows & twist &  turn & then fly around her  stern, then off up past her  her at a tremendous pace  & dodge about all over the  place. Of course the gun  crews are always at their  guns & men on the lookout for any sign of a  periscope. The chaps in  command of these destroyers  are most youthful & very  young in appearance, one  chap I saw was the living  image of our poor Alt &  I could not take my eyes  off him. He was Alts   double in everyway in  appearance. The midshipmen  on the big battleships too, are   only youngsters just out of  college, & some of them are  not more that 13 & 14 years  of age, but they are wonderfully plucky, they were in  charge of the pinnaces that   towed us ashore on the  memorable 25th of April &  altho' shrapnel was flying  about in all directions, they went on with their work  like seasoned veterans.  The Navy are having a good  time in this harbour, they put  nets around the sides of the  ship & there are the Officers   in white clothes playing cricket  & tennis & other games, & the  band playing to them. They  don't steam out unless there  is any big "stunt" on up at  the Peninsular & then they  don't stay for long on  account of the Submarines.  Things have been bungled  from the start over there, but  we hope great things from  Sir Ian Hamiltons successor.  General Munro or something  his name is, but it is a thankless job taking a job  where a another man has been  not so successful as was  expected of him. However,  lets hope it will all be over  soon & peace declared.  You will be sorry to hear of   my dear little pal, Les Ilsley  who was my 2nd Trumpeter in  the old Windsor battery, & went  to New Zealand to do Insurance  office work, he joined the N.Z  mounted forces & came over  here, but has been killed in  Action in the charge of August 6-7  I am terribly grieved & only learnt  of it here whilst reading a  New Zealand newspaper.  Well Mother dear, don't worry  about me, Enteric is not so bad after  all, & Im quite alright. Give my  love to all at Home & elsewhere  & accept a double whack for  your dear self from your  loving son, Norman.
