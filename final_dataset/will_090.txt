H.M.S. CENTURION, C/o G.P.O. 9th June 1917.  My dear General It was very nice of you to write and congratulate me on the arrival of the son - Many thanks - We were all delighted to see your KCB in the Birthday Honours - tho’ we all said it was an outrage that you had not been given one long before - Admiral de Robeck sent me your most interesting account of the A.N.Z AC Corps attack. It is a splendid story and something to be very proud of. I am glad to say Carver is busy given another Command and also a DSO. His salvage of the Monitor’s guns off Smyrna was  a very fine gallant performance
 She was within range of a 6" battery and constantly shelled - they lived in dug outs on an island and swam out to her working naked  many hours at a time. When it was dark lighters were taken to her and after a fortnight of strenuous effort he [[salved?]] guns - shells- machinery etc. The Admiralty refused to do anything  for him because they said de Robeck’s mentions already Exceeded the Admiralty Scale! It seems difficult to settle limit mentions for gallant actions by Scale and unless opportunities are similarly limited - a phrase which we worked into the last letter - and which in the end bore fruit! Very many thanks for your kind letter which my wife and I much appreciated Your Ever Roger Keyes,
