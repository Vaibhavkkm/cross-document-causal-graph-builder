TWIN SCREW STEAMER
23 May 16 At Sea. My dear Mum. Once again on the old sea bound for another country which I can assure you will be greatly appreciated after Egypt. One can hardly realize getting away I sort of feel part of the desert now with its heat flies & sand storms I called Father saying I had left Egypt & expected Nana to follow in the course of a couple of  days. We had a very rough train trip from Serapeum officers & men alike travelling in cattle  trucks t still we knocked out  some fun and every body was  very light hearted & joyful.  the journey to took about 10 hours. This is a fine  vessel about 18,000 tons &  am having a good rest plenty of auction bridge also plenty of good food the change & rest is simply great for all The weather is fine smooth sea & a nice cool breeze which is indeed strange to us. Met Mr Mrs Henley & the girls had a long yarn to them also got lots of tobacco etc it was indeed great to  talk to white ladies again After 2 months on the desert without any leave at all. Have had all sorts of nice letters from Hope Davies she sent her photo and looks very nice too she is 21 yrs old so you see I know all particulars and intend to look her up when in England if lucky enough to go there and am bound to have a good time.  In another day or so we shall reach our destination barring accidents these letters you  may not get & if you do,  are sure to be delayed will write from the other side & let you know all the news. best love to all Bob.
