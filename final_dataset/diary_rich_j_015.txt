Saturday  Oct 17th Our black kit is packed & sent in. It has been raining all the morning, and is disquietening to the boys. All the fellows are delight/ed at getting away, but I am sure they have no idea of the seriousness of their mission, and treat matters very lightly. Many of them are drinking. Yet they are a good set. Only 1 hours drill this morning we then got leave until 9. p.m. Bob Miller, George Hill & myself got into the City by 1 0'clock and had dinner at Sargents, George St. I went to Manly by the 3 p.m. had a shower at Mrs. Hynes. Offered her 10/- which she would not take. I have had a number of meals there & leaving behind my luggage consisting of 1 large portamanteau  3 suit cases 1 fairly large kit bag. She is very very good indeed. Tea at Broads & the last boat back. Camp at 1. a. m.
