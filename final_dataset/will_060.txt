30 BRUTON STREET,  London W.  26.1.1917   Dear Gen Birdwood  I think it is right to let you  know that today. I sent two cablegrams  to Australia, which I reproduce from memory  now.  1. Defence Melbourne Medical Board  certifies me fit Home Service in three weeks, unfit  general service for six months. Understand  through GOC  AIF some difficulty about  employing me Australia meanwhile. Submit  am justly entitled such employment as  recommended by him but prepared serve  England if necessary though climate adverse  to health. Have asked Sir William Irvine to  see you. Gen McCay  2. Sir William Irvine Melbourne. Please  see cable sent by me on this date to Defence  Melbourne relative to my employment  while unfit active service. Gen McCay.
You will thus see that I have asked the Dept.  in Australia to recognise what I report myself  as an equitable right , the more so as you have  specifically recommended it.  If I may, I would like to add that I  still think Australia would be greatly  benefited by having a GOC AIF for England  under you & that I humbly believe I could  do the work & improve the present conditions. I have reason to believe that  the senior officers here would be pleased  at such an arrangement, except Sir N.  Moore, as to whose views I have no  knowledge. I am of course the senior  officer of the Commonwealth Mil Forces serving, &  the senior A.I.F. officer, Legge excepted.  I therefore hope that if Australia has no  suitable work for me there, you will even now  advise them to give me charge here. I will risk  the climate - &. if the war lasts to the autumn,  hope to take the field again. Kindest regards  Yours sincerely, J W McCay
