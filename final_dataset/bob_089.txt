 My dear Mum, Have at last joined the battalion again arriving here last Monday Had quite a good journey up from Etaples leaving there at 7 o'clock in the morning & arriving here at 6.30 the same day Seemed very funny to me this place where the battalion what is left of them are resting was about 4 miles behind the front line last August and shelled by the Huns like the devil now it is very safe being about 30 miles behind the line Of course there are many many changes now very few of the old fellows being left and at present the Coys are very weak am attached to A Coy second x in command of same
to Capt Murray so shall be very busy getting things going again as soon as some more men come along of course you will address all letters to me to the battalion now until further notice expect it will be the best part of a month before we are in action again however there is no telling these days what will happen  It is great getting back again everyone the Colonel etc seemed so pleased to see me and said all sorts of nice things about me and showed what he thought by putting me second in command of a Coy that Such responsibility the worst of having a good reputation what what. Was out doing musketry on a range we have close by to-day of course it was made by us in the open fields 6 or 8 fine young hares appeared no doubt interested in the proceedings but alas for 
them some of the boys saw them and up went rifles with the result that the hares fell so that someone will have a change for tea tonight we bagged 6 all together it was great fun the boys being very tickled. Received 6 letters as soon as I arrived here the mail just being in one from Mick not dated one from Jane dated 29th Jan one from Lorna 1st Feb also one from Dag, Billy, Bull & Lucy Cowdery Am enclosing a post card Marks sent to me which he received from Capt Fox from Germany it should be interesting to you all also the envelope of Janes letter on the back is written damaged by sea water and of course the front shows it apparently a close shave for the poor letter. Am very glad the sea was cheated anyway. Shall answer all the letters I received as soon as possible lots of love to all, Bob.
