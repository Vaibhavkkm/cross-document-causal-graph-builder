(French- Castles & Johansen.)   Thursday  April 29th, 1915.  Fine weather but very hot. Beautiful   full moon at night - great scenes. "Thoughts  in Solitude". Boxing at night several  good men in our lot. Doing very  well at parades - & troop deck cleanliness.  Complemented for both.  No crimes to date - a good record so  far. Rumored that a German interned  vessel has broken from Batavia - no  official notification.
