A 63     My dear mother,  you will probably receive this  letter & the last together as the other is still  in my cabin.  We are in port at present  where I am afraid that I can't tell you  but it's frightfully hot.  We did not  intend to call in anywhere but an  unexpected wireless last night altered  our intentions & here we are for I don't  quite know how long - it may be a   day or it may be a week. We had   great sport crossing the line - a large  swimming bath was rigged up in the  forward hatch & there Neptunes court  was held.  One of the crew was dressed  as Neptune, a big fine built man with  long hair made of rope yarn &  Mrs Neptune's part was taken by  one of the nurses.  All the officers r Colonel  included were the victims & we all  dressed up for the occasion - I borrowed  a ladies bathing costume & accessories  as being & suitable one for the occasion.  The men gave us a preliminary ducking 
before the court was held & afterwards   we were brought before Neptune & his  satellites who were mainly members of  the military police & were dressed up in  all kinds of grotesque costumes mainly  feminine.  The colonel was charged &  ducked first & was followed by the   other officers  The had a pail of flour  & water with which to lather us & a   large flat piece of wood shaped like  a razor for shaving. Graham was   among the first & created amusing  diversions by seizing Neptunes beard  & dragging another chap into the water  with him.  One man was charged with  throwing up the sponge - he had  been sea sick nearly all the time & an operation was  performed on him for it's removal.  I was charged with stealing soap on  the voyage to fill up the dimple in my   chin & was sentenced to have it filled in  permanently on the spot which was done with  a flour pill and water.  One of the nurses was   busy distributing flour & water pills to the   victims.  One chap had to drink his   own medicine.  Another who had been  doing a great deal of inoculation against 
typhoid was charged with annoying  everyone by making their arms sore  & was sentenced to inoculation himself  & this was done by a large garden hose  which was filled with sea water &  squirted over his bare stomach.  I managed to have a lively passage  by grabbing Neptunes rod, & emptying  the tin of flour and water over the   head of the man who was lathering  me & was well ducked afterwards.  We dressed up again next day &  had our photos taken by various people  who had cameras.  It was a very fine  afternoons enjoyment & everyone took the  jokes in good part.  One officer dressed  up as a blackfellow with false nose  & wig & when summoned to appear  clung to the top of the bridge & yelled  out in black fellow fashion that he  was not guilty & would not go &  had to be chased then escaped at  the right moment & was followed by  a long line of dressed up men in  chase.  It was very funny - the best  piece of the day.  We had a dance at night   but it was rather warm & I only had about three dances. We have  had a very pleasant trip & I am in very good  health & spirits, thought of you on  Sunday evening before tea singing  hymns in the drawing room at Fairview  & hoped that you were not too lonely  or anxious & depressed as all is well  with us here.  It is rumoured that we  may be able to cable for half rates toward  the end of the week & if we are still  here I shall probably do so but if we   are away by then shan't bother as  it won't take so very long to finish the  journey.  We have had one death on board,  one of the Queensland Light Horse who had  meningitis - his funeral was very impressive as in  addition to the burial at sea it was a military  funeral.  The body was wrapped in a flag &  carried by his comrades who were in full uniform  - the chaplain read the burial services as   the body remained on planking at the side  of the ship ready to be committed to the  deep.  All the troops were present, & officers  in parade uniforms & nurses also. Then  after the final solemn words were spoken  the body was let go & xx his own special  comrades fired three resounding volleys 
over him & were marched back in silence to  their quarters.  Everyone was visibly impressed  by the ceremony. I have a walk up & down  the deck almost every day with the  chaplain who is a very nice fellow, very Scotch  but as usuall very well versed in literature  We have seen the usual sharks whales  porpoises & flying fish & have fortunately  been blessed with favorable head winds  which have been cool & f crossing the  Equator I did not feel it at all hot  nor indeed until yesterday. But at  present we are certainly in a hot place  & can expect nothing else, but even here  it is by no means unbearable. The troops  are in good condition & fairly healthy &  in good spirits . At present we are besieged  by the usual black fellows in boats doing  their best to make money by woking the  public but the troops are equal to  them Must close now my dear with  the best of love to yourself & all  the Evans Thomas family hoping  you are all well & in good fettle  as we are,    from  Your loving son  Wilf.  I would like some good substantial war news  Heard some little bit today of a German cruiser being sunk by Submarine.
