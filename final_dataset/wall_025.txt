In The Trenches  Somewhere in Frances  12/6/1916   Dear Mum  Well old lady I am well & I hope that  you are the same at home. I received your  parcel & letter dated April 16th Today & my word  you must of known just what I wanted.  especially about the handkerchiefs as I have got  a bit of a cold & we cant buy any over here   The socks were alright & also the laces & buttons   & net. We are fairly well looked after here  we get a good hot bath & a change of clothing  at least once a week. We strip & get into   a great big hot bath about 20 at a time   & my word you do feel alright afterwards  especially if you have just done about   12 days in the trenches. We have not  made our raid get there was two parties   of us training & I think they tossed up   who won & the others did. They went over  to the German trenches & raided them   & killed a lot of Germans & took some    prisoners. We are having our turn this week
for sure & you may be sure that I will   bring some sovenirs back & we got English   leave immediately afterward so I will be able  to send you some home whatever I get. I have   had several letters from Blanche & she is getting   on alright. I got that photo of Blanche &   yourself & it was just it. I can tell you   & you can thank Glady for me what for the   way that she did it up. I am writing to   Everill with the same mail as this, you say   that you have not been getting any letters   lately well I assure you that I write regularly  & I always write to Ev at the same time so   I dont know why you are not receiving them  I expect that we were shifting to France when  you missed getting them. I know that they   would not let any letters go away from here   for some time. Well I must close now with   love to you & all at home from  your loving son,  Wally.
