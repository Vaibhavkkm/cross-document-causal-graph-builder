October 14th 1917.   Dear Sir William.  May I on  behalf of myself and the 9th Aus Infantry Brigade tender our very sincere congratulations on your recent appointment as A.D.C General to His Majesty, and your promotion to General rank. Every additional honour you receive is a source of the liveliest satisfaction to us all - but at the same time we hope your new rank will not mean severance from the Australian Forces. 
We are now settled in our new Sector (old sector to many of us) and we find the conditions concerning accommodation for front line troops is quite good.     Yours Sincerely, Charles Rosenthal
