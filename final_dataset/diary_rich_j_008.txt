Saturday    Oct 10th The whole company marched down to Bondi beach yesterday afternoon and all enjoyed it immensely. The men behaved splendidly, their patience in the refreshment room was splendid while the rush was on Captian Welch was in his glory. The day was very hot, the first real summer was experienced. It is raining to-day and we have had no drill but plenty of guards. Disasifaction reigns supreme. I wish we were away and busy at work. There was no leave to-night but as W.Z. came down to the Park we ^a had tea at the dainty tea shop in this delightful Park. I got back to camp before 10 o'clock.
