9th L. H. Regiment  Racecourse Camp, Cairo.  Should be +
3 January 1916, 
 Read this letter first     Hope to write to individual members of family as soon as  possible. 
 My dear mother,  On my arrival here  a few days ago I was delighted to  receive the letters for which I had  been longing for months, also parcels  & papers. Your billy can was   the first thing to meet the eye,  and a box of [[?]] from Mab, books  & writing paper from Harry & a   couple of parcels which Stephen  had sent me from Egypt. All had   evidently been held up at Lemnos  on account of the evacuation &  sent back here. And do you know,  I received four of the first letters  you ever sent dated June &  July which had been sent away  from 1st A. G. Hospital by mistake to another Evans & since then  have been wandering about  Egypt & Gallipoli looking for  me. How delightful it was to  receive such recent news of you  as the end of November & to find  that you had reconciled yourself  to all my being at Gallipoli, I  find lots of things to which I  should reply in your letters &  will read them through again  when I am finished this & reply  if necessary. But firstly please  do take a holiday - I hate  to think of you staying altogether  in Candelo & I should be so  happy if you would take £20  or as much more as you wish  from what is being sent to you  for me & go away & kick  over the traces for a while Don't beggar yourself by  giving too liberally to war funds   - we will all have to pay enough  later on. I think I missed  your letter which stated that  Ern & Alice had left you - I   wondered if it was just at  the time when I sent you my cable  on going to Gallipoli. Well, let   me tell you some news. We waited  a day at Alexandria before  landing then the few men in  my regiment who were with  me were enabled to go ashore  & we obtained a railway warrant  for Cairo for the six train in the   evening. That gave us time  to trot round Alexandria in  the day. We all lunched together  in the morning & then I set  out to look for Cousin Gwen 
wherever she might be.  I went first to No XIX  General Hospital from there  to a nurses home, from there  to No XV General, & from there  to more nurses homes &  eventually tracked her down  but found she was out. It  was then about 3.30 pm.   & I had to leave at 6 pm.  so you can imagine that  I was disappointed. However  they said she would be going  on duty at 5 pm. so I went  back to town had some  afternoon tea & came back  to the hospital or rather the   house where the nurses abode  & after more enquiries the lady appeared. So we  squatted down & exchanged  notes but she had only 15   minutes before going on duty  which was a shame. I thought  it too bad when one saw an  overseas cousin for the first  time to leave in 15 minutes  for good so I chanced the  military authorities sent the  others on by the six oclock  train & waited for the 11.30  myself. She was off duty  at 8 pm & I called round  then expecting to go for  a [[garry]] drive with her but  a new rule has come out  for British nurses that they  canno are not allowed to go  out with khaki so we  sat & talked in the drawing room 
which was just as good.  She told me lots of things  about the Evansess &  was sorry she had not the  family pedigree or what can  you call it with her - said  it was very good came from  the Welch kings & so on - very  amusing. She is a very nice  lassie 24 years old & a B.A.  of Oxford where she used to  play hockey with the Intervarsity  teams so must be  some athlete. She has the  usual peachy English complexion  & blue eyes is of moderate  height & sturdy. Am not  yet in love with her though I  suppose you & father will be   sure to think so. She told me that Ernest Hughes is very  sweet on one of her sisters - funny  isn't it. Don't pass it on to  Auntie Lily. She showed me  various photos of English cousins  which were very interesting. I   left about ten oclock & went  walked over along to the hotel  where I had left my baggage  consisting of pack, [[for tack]] waterbottle  & haversack, my only worldly  possessions, all portable & there  met one of the officers who  had been ill & comments   joined us at Lemnos & we had  quite a pleasant chat till  it was time for me to go to my  train. I there engaged a  sleeping berth & dossed therein  giving instructions to the porter 
not to call me until 7 am.  although the train arrived at  Cairo at 5 a.m. Then I went  to bed & woke when the man  called me in the morning,   got up & dressed & caught  the tram to Heliopolis &   walked on here. We are  a little crowded at present  on account of the large  number of troops suddenly  dumped into Egypt but I  was very glad to be here  again for a while. I went  over to the Hospital in  the afternoon & was  greeted back cordially  by a lot of old acquaintances  many of whom greeted me 
as one returned from the dead  for rumor had it that I  had departed this life at  Lemnos. Next day Wesley  & I, for we had joined  up again here, went into   town together as I needed  so many things - clean  underclothes & a watch -   for I had lost the one  you gave me at Gallipoli  & various other oddments  such as towels etc. I forgot  to mention that Wesley told  me that on his boat coming  over he had met my cousin  Major John Evans as I had  told Charles about him at  Gallipoli  & when he heard  that there was a Major Evans aboard he accosted  him & asked him whether  he was my cousin & found  he was. Charley told him  all about me & the old  boy was delighted to  hear that I was a medico.  What a coincidence wasn't   it! - Well we went to  Cairo & while passing Shepheard's Hotel suddenly  Charley exclaimed "Why  there's your cousin now."  & sure enough it was,   He was delighted to see  me & told me he was  pleased that I was  a doc as nearly all  the forefathers had been in the profession that the maker of Thomas' splints was an ancestor. It's funny that English people love ancestry & Australians don't care very much. He was such a jovial little man & I liked him immensely, he remembers you well & said to ask you if you remember making tea for him & another young man who lived opposite. We could not stay very long as he had to run away but I hope to go to Wardan where he is at present about 1½ hours trip from here tomorrow if possible & have quite a long chat. Yesterday afternoon Charley & I went into Cairo to meet Buchanan who was in our year & has been here since the commencement of the war. His mother & sister have recently come over & are staying in Cairo & we went with them to look over an old mosque & then to an afternoon tea at the home of the Minister for the Interior who holds an afternoon tea every fortnight for military folk. Good number of people were there but it was rather boring. Went to church after packed full. Hand tired best love for all & a double share to mother from Her loving son, Wilf.

The cake was a beauty, the men in the tent all send thanks.
