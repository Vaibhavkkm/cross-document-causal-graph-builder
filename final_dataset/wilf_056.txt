This is  written under the shade of a  palm tree in a nice little desert oasis.  GRAND HOTEL CONTINENTAL PORT-SAID (EGYPTE) SIMONINI FRÈRES PROPR. le ...   ln the desert 17.7.1916   My dear mother, I have been unable to write for a couple of weeks as we have been on the move & no postal arrangements have been possible but we are sending back some men today & they will take this. I have no envelopes but they will put it in one for me at the base. We moved out about two weeks ago when the Turks made their attack on the Canal &  after two or three lively scraps our division gave them a thorough defeat & we have followed hard on their heels. They have now gone right back & we are now in no danger so don't worry at all. This regiment has done very well as in one day it alone captured over 300 prisoners & another regiment which supported it brought the days total for the Brigade to 425 & 8 machine guns which was very good. We have had a good deal of hard riding & long days but are now resting on our oars. I will give you a more detailed account when I get some paper & envelopes & will try & send a cable but don't see much prospect as we are so far from cable station. I am in excellent health so cheer up my dear  I do hope you also are well. Best of love to all & a double share for mother from Her loving son, Wilf
