05.05.1914  S.S. Yankalilla  Port Pirie     Dear Mother  Just a line to let you know  that we arrived here today from  Adilade I have been in this ship  now over three months now I wrote   a letter to you last month and  one the month before and I sent  three pound in each letter I expect  that you have got them by now  Well Mother I got a letter from Annie  with your letters and she was telling  me that you had been poorly but  I hope that you are all right again  by now I wish you were keeping in  the same sort of health as I am  at present I never felt better in  my life before I got weighed last  night and I went 12 stone 4 pound  so that is not a bad weight for  a man working in the stokehole  and doing plenty of hard solid  work I am going to try and hang  this ship down for another
eight or nine months and then  I am coming home so see and  start looking your best for next  year for I am getting about sick  and tired of knocking about out  here and you know the old  saying that "Every bird likes  its own nest Best" so you can  look out for me next month year  even if I land home broke  Now Mother tell Annie that  I got her letters all right and  the Gazzettes and I have just  got a letter from the Customs  to tell me that they have got  the box that she sent out  but I will get it when I get  to Newcastle this trip Jack  Jackson is still in the ship with  me Well Mother I will now draw  to a close with love to you  and Annie I remain  Your Loving Son  Jack
