 My dear Mum, No news just a line to let you know I am quite all right & still going strong. It is very cold of course plenty of snow and cold winds yet it does not affect me one simply growls & swears and cold feet hands & ears all day & night to. We expect to move away from here any day now and no doubt shall be having another crack very shortly. Do not know what has gone wrong with the Aust. mail we have had no letters for six weeks & the Xmas parcels I expect are still kicking around some of the wharves. however if lucky
we may receive them eventually. Have just received a large bundle of English papers from Hope so shall have a good old read tonight. Went to a most interesting lecture last night at a Corp Head Quarters Cannot tell you the subject but it was very fine given by a civilian probably something to do with the Secret Service but for flow & command of the English language I have never heard anything to touch him. Sat on a chair for 1 hour & a half never once repeated himself & never had a note it was indeed the finest lecture I have ever heard. Have not seen Nana yet. having had no opportunity however expect to see him shortly lots of love to all,  Bob.
