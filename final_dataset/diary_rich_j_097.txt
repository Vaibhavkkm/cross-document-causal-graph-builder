October 1st Thursday    General leave 5.30. to 10 pm Flag drill ^signaling has been much practiced during the past few days Capt. Poate, who has only had a few lessons himself, took over the instruction of A Section with astounding confidence and done ^did so well that few could have known his short experience with Semaphore   signaling with flags. In the afternoon we went out for practical stretcher drill and "first aid dressings" it was very good practice. A cricket match commenced at 3.30 between A & B sections I got up the teams but did not play as there where such a lot of keen players but alas, as could only be expected the more they talked of past performances and pleaded for a game the worse bally cricketers they were. Tea with Cis Sponza  & Mrs. Kennard Camp at 10 o'clock
