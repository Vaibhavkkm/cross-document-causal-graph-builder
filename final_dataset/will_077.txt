  Publishing Office: 17 GROSVENOR STREET, SYDNEY.        March 27th, 1917.   General Sir William Birdwood, White Man & Officer Commanding the Anzacs, "SOMEWHERE IN FRANCE".   Sir, By this mail we have posted you a copy of "The Soldier", the property of two boys who were with you at Gallipoli, and the official organ of the Returned Sailors & Soldiers’ Imperial League of Australia.   "The Soldier" fought strenuously for conscription, and is now fighting hard for the boys abroad and at home.   Our sincere wish is that you be with the boys till the end - the victorious end.  We know how they love you in their manly way, and that your presence in command means so much to them in their trials.   Our highest regards and kindly memories of a White Man.   Yours Faithfully Walter Morris Editor. (Late First Battalion A.I.F.)
