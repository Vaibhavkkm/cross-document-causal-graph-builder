Rollestone.  Salisbury Plains.  England, November 26th. 1916 Dear Mum,  Well old lady I am not  dead yet you see. although I   suppose by the length of time  since my last letter you will  have been wondering what  has happened. Well I have been  flying around all over the place  well I will give you a detail  of what has happened in about  the last 3 weeks. as you know  Blanche & you and Ev & all the rest  are always saying that I never  say much about anything. Well  here goes.  Before we left Scotland  we had a trip up to Aberdeen.  & it is a jolly fine place & I can  tell you it is alright. on our way   up we stopped at Perth for a 
day or so & had a good look around  I have sent Ev a whole bundle   of Post Cards with this Mail & I  will tell her to show them to you  & I want her to keep them because  I have seen every one of the places  & it will be alright when I come   home to sit and explain all of  them to you and Ev. We saw  the Fish Market at Aberdeen.  & by jove they do send some  fish through there. I think  they send bring in there alone  about 1200 tons of fish daily. so  you can see what it would  be like. Then we came down  to Dundee & spent some time  there. & Sterling. & just after  we left Dundee we crossed  over the Tay Bridge & it is quite
a long bridge. but it is not such a fine Structure as the  Forth Bridge which we crossed over some time  later. The  train passes right over it & the bridge is high enough for  a full rigged ship to pass underneath easily so that  will give you some idea of the height & it is about a  mile long. & you can see all the battleships lying just  inside the Firth of Forth. But taking the whole run  down & up to Aberdeen it was very pretty indeed & I  wish you had only been there to see it. Then we came   down & stopped at Glasgow for a couple of days & then  we went back to Gailes where we got orders to  report to  our headquarters at Horseferry Rd London. Well we  had a very pretty run down to London about 8 or 9  hours of it. well when we got there we were told that  we could have a first class warrant to wherever we  wanted to go & my chum & I took ours at out to  Belfast in the North of Ireland via Wales & Dublin.
So you might well know that we had laid ourselves in for  a good time. Well we had a splendid trip through England &  Northern Wales & I can tell you Wales seemed just lovely. one  could fancy oneself on the front of that train that you see  in the pictures where they take all the scenic pictures from  I can tell you I was taking good stock of it all & if I do  get back won't I have some tales to tell you. I guess  I shall make your mouth water won't I? Well we got to a  place called Holyhead. where we caught the Irish mail -  boat to Kingston (about 5 miles from Dublin) we got there  about 8 in the evening. Well next day we had g a good  look around Dublin & I can tell you we did not like  it one seap. But there are some splendid Buildings there  & I think Phoenix Park in Dublin is about as fine a  Park as I have seen yet. But by jove the Rebels.  made a men there you haven't no idea what it is like  both sides of the main street is levelled to the ground &  what beats me there is the number of men walking.
about. there are thousands & one wouldn't mind if they  were on war work. but to think that England  has to keep a whole lot of troops there just watching  the swine. & I can assure you that seemingly  the whole of the Irish people are the same even  to a large extent in Ulster. Well at anyrate we did not  like Dublin. then we went on to Drogheda but we  were not long enough there to form much of an  opinion of them. Well after a very good run up through  Ireland we arrived at Belfast & we had a good  look around & liked it alright. Then we were  having a look around at the Belfast Town Hall & I believe  it is noted as the best in the world & it is the  best I have seen so far. Well while we were in  there we met a lad about 17 who offered to show  us around & so we had a good look round  with him & afterward we met his father who
would have us go home with them to tea & he  offered to put us up for our stay in Belfast but  we did not like to encroach too much upon their  good nature. but at anyrate we went home with them  & we met his wife & daughter & two sons & spent  a great evening. And next day he arranged for us  to be shown round. Spinning & Weaving & Finishing Mills.  The Largest Shipyard in the British Isles. or about the  largest. The Belfast Rope Works & I know this is the  largest of its kind in the world. & we saw all round  a Technical College with practically every machinery  under the sun. Anyhow we had quite an interesting  time of it & we went out there to tea again before   we left Belfast & they were down at the train to  see us off & put horse shoes in our pockets for   luck & all sorts of things. They have got a fairly  large Linen warehouse themselves & do a fairly large business.
anyhow after the same run back to London we reported  to our Headquarters where they told us we had our  commissions so you might guess we lost no time in  getting our stars up. Then we got orders to Shift down  to Salisbury Plains. I have not seen Bob yet but I  will as soon as I can & I will be sure & see him  before I go to france France again which from what I  can hear will be bf before the week is out as our lot  has been cut to ribbons. only about 3 officers & about 100  men left in our Batt so that will give you some idea.  We are nicely fixed up down here we have a good mess  & good batmen who does everything for us. I sent you a  cable saying we were Commissioned we dated from 23rd Oct.  & if we get back now & have any luck we shall soon  get well up the ladder won't it be alright if I came home  a Major.. I don't think. Well love to all at home & I hope  Dad is alright now not forgetting yourself & Jack & all the  rest. Well I must push off now, from your loving Son  Wally..
