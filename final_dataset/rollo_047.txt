Text:  Just a short note - very busy. Just had instructions to take over Com of A Co. as Capt Rumfall is sick. Doubled up with lumbago & has to go to Hospital I've been running C. Co in place of Cornish away ill too while Jock Hamilton has also been in Hosp. & yesterday resumed command for first time - so I'm well in the midst of work This wont alter my title for the present - as Stopp Hening & Lontit are all about due for return any time now. - Being O.C. is a pretty stiff job as I have a flighty lot of officers under me - but I daresay they'll soon get used to me. Gawler Coombe one of the teachers at A.H.S. is my Sgt Maj.- but I don't think we'll find this awkward - & anyhow we wont quarrel very much now. Recd. mail tdy. 2. 3 & 8. but have only had time to scan through it yet. Much love.
