Sun. Jan. 6, 1918
Weather: mild, clear, a spring day Health: good
Up at 6:30. Oatmeal, ham, coffee. Read and loaf. Shave. Wait impatiently for Leah to come. A most glorious day. Sun shines. It is warm and the sky is blue and clear as a June day. Boys out in firebreak with basketballs, footballs, medicine balls and baseballs. Windows are wide open. I sit on steps. I wait for Leah. 12:00 o’clock. At 12:45, Leah has not yet arrived, so I go in for mess. Soup, leg of lamb, corn, potatoes, pudding, coffee. Hardly started, when Leah comes. She looks so well I am proud of her. Rebekah with her. I wash my mess kit and go with them. Sam and Margaret waiting for me too, so we all go together to YMCA hostess house, where we have a good dinner. Rebekah very anxious to see Grametstein. We go to look for him. Do not find him after a long search, so go over to see Mark. We lose Sam, Margaret and Rebekah on the way, but run into Graumy. We congratulate him. He must get back to quarters, so we go to Mark’s place. He is sick, so after a few minutes we go back to look for Rebekah. We find them outside our quarters and introduce the girls to boys. Sam, Margaret and Rebekah had been through my barracks, for which Sgt. Carrao gets call. Rosenbaum has come back and is under guard, a prisoner at this cot which is next to mine. Retreat. To hostess house with Zucker for supper. I steal a few kisses on road. We dine, after which we find chairs and go over a few business matters. Graumy comes. Zucker leaves. We go to station and put girls on 7:30 train. Parting not so hard, because I know Leah has company. Take Salome home. Stop at AM&C for a drink. Make bed. Read peace speech of Lloyd George. Go to PO to mail special delivery letter to Leah. Paper I forgot to give her. Go to bed at 10. For me a delightful holiday, which ended too soon. We see panoramic view of camp from tower.
