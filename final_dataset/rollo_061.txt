Text:  Your letter end of Sept & found this morning  also from Bema, Dr Schulz & George. Parcel from  Bema very acceptable indeed - especially fine cap - comforter, mittens, & flynet - latter not needed now - as flies have disappeared.  Things go just the same, - a half hearted  attack on some L.H. trenches about half a mile  to our right - providing a little variation. One  of my platoon was shot in the eye, and one  of my own men (Ashcroft) got a lump of stone  in his forehead from a richochet. It about  knocked him out - but he just had his head  bandaged & then carried on as usual.  Two or three others of my chaps have been  wounded - & stuck it out. Philps, Ween, & Bland,  K.O.K. is due here in a few days, & I  wonder what he will think of the "glorious muddle" this business has been converted into.  He's got 'his' army to thank for it, not ours.  Our relief is still held back - (submarine  scares &c.) - but its solid the way they are  treating us the 3rd Brigade & the L.H. We went  through the strain of the initial occupations,  & have held on against most rigorous attacks. 
Bema mentioned rumors about us being  bound for England, but its not too much England we'll see. Only senior officers & extreme cases are being sent there - others to Egypt - or severe cases (conval) to Australia  Just 24 weeks I've been here and am looking  forward to a good spell - but if we are pulled  out wed be back again in a month or so.  Brig. Gen. Maclagan is on his way back here -  so we may soon find out we are not the  'Cinderellas' as we've been called since Sept.  Our latest recreation is sniping at M.G. positions  rather futile and risky - but still when 8 or 9  rifles plump shots into or about a M.G. from  various places - the enemy think it is time to  dismount M.G. & imshi In this way we stop a  lot of harassing us - Beachy Bill battery is  still effective - also a very mobile 7.5 mm Battery  on Gun Ridge which gives us a warm time - but  rarely puts anyone out. This battery was got  by the Bulgarians from France in 1909 - & was  taken by the Turks. Jacko also has a battery  of 18 pdrs which were made for New Zealand  but N.Z. altered their plans, & England sold the -  lot to Jacko - so now they're against us here and  at Helles too. 
Jacko has a very mixed lot - 75s, 9.12., 18 pdrs.  3.7, 4.2, 8.2, & 11.2 but much of the 8.2 stuff is  dud stuff. Dr Nott has a photo of seven which  landed within space 5 yds. square - & didn't 'bust.'  During the Save Bahr action we (10th) got well  over 60 of these 'duds' - & we hope they keep up the same class of ammunition or we'd get fits.  The 11.2 blew the top off one or two hills in our  sector - but the navy is supposed to have put  it out of action. As 11.2 are only on the 'Greben'  I guess they've moved back into Sea of Marmara  The R.N. cut up the W.A. L. Horse & certainly blew the Ghurkas off 971 - & as we see no battleships now our opinion of the R.N. is going south.  Lizzie P.W. or Bacchaute were & are O.K. -  & so were 'Majestic' & 'Triumph' - but the Admiralty messed up this job properly in Feb. & March.  We get whips of good news from Russia,  France & Servia - but I guess most of it is "hot  air". I had the job of showing some Pommie  "officials" round our lines - & it made me sick to hear the patronising Stra-ordinary! What! These bally Australians are ingenious beggars arent they That! I lost my temper at last & rapped out - My blinking oath - & what's more what we ____ ___ get  we ___ ___ stick to too". No more was said by these chaps - they'd lost 971 - they processed the rest of the way like "Chokoes'. Good luck best wishes, Rollo
