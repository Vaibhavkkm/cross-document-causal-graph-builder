Kind regards to you.  Redburg (Major) looked a bit washed out after his first experience in the firing line - but Hamilton, Short, Giles were the same as ever.  Giles is a fine man about equal to Herbert. I saw most of my old platoon, most belong to other platoons & are wearing stripes.  Hamilton is not now with C. & one of sgts remarked 'the officers in C are not the ones we used to have'.  Many of the C. boys wanted to come here - or follow 'Jack'.  We have a name which the 3rd Brigade is proud of & Col. Weir reckoned we'd done him "proud." Aeroplanes in the early morning & evening remind me of a mosquito swarm.  We send up anything up to 20 : 1 as regards the Huns - and the shells used in bringing down one aeroplane are legion.  It is marvellous the escapes which each plane has. Every aviator who does a trip over Fritz deserves a D.S.O - as he must get anything up to 200 shells shot at him every five minutes - so when you see 6 aeroplanes brought down - you can reckon each of those 6 clipped a shell after dodging some thousands. We have not seen any Zeps. yet - but Fritz has a fair supply of Observation balloons.  I saw our guns bring down 5 one evening. "Raids" are the latest stunts here.  The Old Brigade got off 2 last week - just in our immediate front.
