Regiment: 1st. Anzac Corps, 

Date: 4th. May 1917.  Dear Henderson, I write to congratulate you most heartily upon the Military Cross, which has been awarded to you for your conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in the fighting at Hermies on the 9th. April. I know how untiringly you worked in the care  and treatment of the wounded, and on clearing all the cases from the regimental aid post, you went forward under heavy fire, and attended to those who were lying near our objective. Later, too, I know that you treated every wounded man in the village at great personal risk, and that, as a result of your assuidity and courage all our wounded and many wounded prisoners were cleared by noon, which meant so much in alleviating their sufferings. Thank you so much for your good work, and with good wishes for the future. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.)  W. Birdwood.
