20 July 1915  Geo. Barrett Lennard Esq.  "St Leonards"   Guildford W.A.   Dear Mr Lennard  It is with feelings of extreme  sympathy that I find it my painful  duty to inform you that your son  Douglas Barrett-Lennard was killed on 17th  inst whilst serving at his gun in action.  He bore his wounds with great  fortitude & died in a very gallant &  unselfish manner.  The officers - Non commissioned officers  & men of my Battery join me in conveying  to you & your family their heartfelt  condolences on the death of our gallant  comrade. His death will be a great  & distinct loss to the Battery as he  proved himself an efficient & very  gallant soldier & had he survived
would certainly have received  recognition of his many good  qualities.  It is men of his stamp who  are today unholding the glorious  traditions of the British Army.  Please accept my sincere  sympathy in your sad bereavement.  A.J Besell-Browne  Major  Commanding 8th Battery     P.S. I attach a copy of the  official report of his officer which  I am sure you will be pleased to  receive. It speaks for itself.
