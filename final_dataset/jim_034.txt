France, 9/4/16.
Dearest Mother & Father,
 Just a line to let you know that
since I last wrote my address has been
altered slightly. It is now:-
No.  Name,
21st Infantry Battalion, A.I.F.,
2nd A.D.B.D.,
C/o A.P.O - S17,
B. E. F.,
France.
There has been nothing of note since my
last letter. "Everything in the garden is
looking lovely and there is every prospect
of rain." I am still in a training
camp doing plenty of training and
feeling better than ever before. It is
pretty cold some days but we are used to
it by now. There is not much to write
about as I am always in camp and 
each day is practically alike.  We had
an easy day yesterday (Saturday). We were
paid  (£2/3/-) and issued with tobacco.
 In the afternoon there was a football match
between my unit and the artillery, which we
won. I quite enjoyed the game and hope
they will come off pretty often. We might as well be isolated at
Broadmeadows as be in this camp. Apart 
from the few French girls and women
about the camp selling oranges and
collecting washing there is very little
to remind us that we are in France.
We are much more settled down than
when we were in the Melbourne camps.
Now one is much more contented to stay
in camp and make the most of one
another's company. It is surprising
how quickly each day passes. The meals
seem to come very soon after one another.
It is just as well for they are not
exactly Sunday dinners we are getting.
 Are you getting my letters regularly?
I have written often and regularly so
that you would not be worrying if I
missed a mail. I am looking forward
to getting some letters shortly. It is
about time some "came to light."
Did you get the parcel I sent from
Egypt? I hope you did, for buying it left
me "broke" for three weeks.
I shall write again shortly.
Love from Jim
