H.M.A.S. AUSTRALIA.  At Sea. Saturday  September 5th  1914    My dear Helen  We left Suva (Fiji) yesterday  morning and we are now on our  way to meet an Australian expeditionary  force which I am going to take with  me to capture some German  possessions to the North East of New  Guinea. Rabaul is one place and  Herbertshire another they are not   far from one another in a big  bay in the island of New Britain  it is the place I went to first of  all and routed them out there  but I had no troops to land to  hold the place then, but now I  shall have plenty, the place was   undefended the last time we were  there, and there were no German ships 
but we may find something  this time although I dont  expect to. I believe they are  either hiding away amongst some  of the more distant Pacific islands  or they may be on their way  across to America, anyhow they  have done no harm to our trade  as yet, but I wish we could run   them to earth and have done with   them but it is almost impossible  in a big place like the Pacific,  and with so few ships to do it  and now some of my ships will  be wanted to convoy the European  Australian Expedition. Patey,
