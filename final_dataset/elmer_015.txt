I will finish this rather rambling letter now. We had mail from the States today,
but much to my disappointment I received nothing from Bloomington. I had a letter from
Alida Ashley written April 11th, also several other letters from Ottawa and a box of
stuffed dates from Ashleys. One of the letters stated that Bloomington went dry in April.
Hope it’s true.
I am enclosing a little remembrance for you, which I picked up several weeks ago
in.
We went about four miles this morning in motor trucks to get a chance to bathe in
a canal. It surely was a much appreciated treat. Will close now, with much love to all.
