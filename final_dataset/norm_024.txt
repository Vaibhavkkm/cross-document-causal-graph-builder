Text:    Dearest Mother & all at Home,  Another line to let you know   that I am still in the best of health & am having the best   of good times, altho’ getting a little tired of Egypt, or I   should say, Mena Camp & the Desert. The flies & mosquitoes   are most troublesome now:  They are the most persistent pests   one could possibly conceive; Food on the table looks simply   disgusting through the flies & we simply have to go down to the Sergeants   Canteen & get some Ham Sandwiches & a Soft drink & say   nasty things about Egypt. We have had all kinds of rumours  as to our departure & we have been packted up all ready to   move off at an hours notice, but always at the last ten or  fifteen minutes, down comes an order cancelling previous   orders & so we go on day after day expecting a move   which which  never seems to come. It has had a sort of   depressing effect on the chaps in the Batteries as they are   getting very stale in their work & it can’t be wondered at   either, because there is no more monotonous place in the   whole world as the Sahara Desert. We start off in the   morning at 9am & the poor horses have to drag the heavy   guns & wagons through the loose sand into the Desert   about 4 or 5 miles & to make matters worse, the poor Gunners 
have to get off the vehicles & walk the whole way & in the   face of that the Section Officers (who ride out) rouse the very   deuce out of them for not keeping up with the guns.  By   the time we get out to the manoeuvre ground, the horses are   in a lather & have done more than an ordinary days   work.  Once we are out there, we do practically nothing,   as officers generally have a “Pow wow” (lecture & a whisky) &   we leave there about 2.30 & get back to camp at 4pm   & this cuts us down to 2 meals per day, so you can   see why we are getting tired of the place.   To-day, however, we had a variety or a change rather.   Private Pickles of the 1st Field Ambulance died at Mena House   of Pneumonia after 5 days sickness through sleeping out   whilst drunk & the usual thing developed, so yesterday   we were detailed to supply a gun carriage & team & as   myself & subsection were told off of for the duty, I will give   you a short description of the Parade. First we had to   fix the coffin board on to the top of my gun & shield (this   was made by the Engineers when we first got here & is in  use nearly every day, so this will tell you how many deaths   are taking place) we all got polished up & hooked in   & proceeded to Giza tram terminus & the special tram arrived   at 11.am (50 minutes late) with the coffin, band & firing party   & the rest of the Ambulance people. The first car held the coffin (covered with flowers & Union Jack, Hat & belt)  & the second trailer contained the Firing Party & Band &   the third trailer held the rest of his company. Before   this arrived, I might state that whilst we were waiting   at Giza, all the niggers for miles around congregated   about the gun carriage in idle curiosity, telling each   other in their own lingo all about the gun & what a   jabbering there was too & the smell of them was not of   Roses, nor yet Violets & I cant say that I could identify   migniontte about it, however whilst their jabbering was   at its highest, two native policemen arrived on the scene  armed with canes, & they proceeded to lay about them   right & left & some of the niggers stopped it over the   ears & neck & other exposed portions of their anatomy   & the squealing was to be heard for a hundred yards   off. One nigger who was selling beer & other drinks had   his tray snatched from him & dashed to the grounds, so   that glass was scattered in all directions. He tried to remonstrate with the policeman but before he had   uttered two syllables he was thrashed unmercifully   & then tripped up & sent sprawling into a dirty ditch.   Whilst all this confusion was at its highest, the tram   arrived & everything then went nice & quiet. The firing   party & band formed up in front of us & the rest of his company. He came from New South Wales & the   band was one of Sydneys best & we started off to the   strains of Chopins Funeral March. It is very difficult   to get our horses to walk so slowly, but my capable   drivers were quite equal to the occasion & the traces  were nice & tight all the way. Handels Dead March   ame next & then we quickened till about ½ a mile   from the Cemetery & then Chopins again. Unlike a   military funeral in Melbourne, the band goes to the   graveside as well & they played “Lead Kindly Light  & "Nearer my God to Thee” very impressively. The   cemetry was for English speaking people & a portion   of it is reserved for the Military Forces. Whilst the   service was on, a plague of locusts was in the   cemetry & there was not millions or billions, but   trillions of them & we could not see the walls of   the cemetry & when we were returning to Camp,   they were everywhere. It was a unique spectacle.  Most of the hospitals here are run by the London   Territorials now & have taken over from the Australians   so this looks like as if we won’t be here for long.   I am making a lot of bad mistakes in spelling & ommissions in this letter but as I am writing in   the mess room, there is every noise conceivable &  arguments (political & otherwise) prevail & I have   to knock off to “bog” in myself & the consequence is,   I hardly know what I am writing at times.   Charlie Sheldrake (who Mab knows) is a great Labour   man & can get up an argument in any time.   Jack Hall is out of Hospital again, I am glad   to say, after his attack of Influenza.  All the other boys are well, but Dowsett is beginning   to go mad again & is not happy unless he has some body  up before the Major.  We are clipping our horses now & I am quite an  experienced hand at the game.   I am sending along a couple of Post Cards of Tommy   Goodall & Mrs Moon which will swell the collection.   I will send along some more of the gun being floated   over the canal & some others next week.   I hope you got the reserved (another argument) registered parcel also   the Souvenir of Egypt which I sent to you a fortnight   ago. Well Mother dear, I’ve had my little “say” this   week so will close with the best of love to you all   at home & kindest regards to all enquirers.   I remain  Your loving Son  Norman.  Excuse the writing as the  noise is maddening
