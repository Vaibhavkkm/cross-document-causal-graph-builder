12. 2. 1916  My dear mother, Another quiet & uneventful week has passed by & we are still in our little camp by the sea. We have had quite a number of visitors this week, almost every meal we have had two or thee extra & have had some merry meetings, generally ending with a little game of bridge or some old game such as Rickety Kate which a number can play at the same time. During the day we have been indulging in a little Ambulance drill which has been interesting as I have never done very much of it before. Beyond this, my dear there is practically nothing to tell you as day follows day with little change. One day however I rode up to see Parry, who was in my year & came came over with me in the same boat & is now attached to another ambulance. We had lunch together & a long talk over old times. It was quite a pleasant ride along the beach for 3 or 4 miles. Then yesterday afternoon, lo! & behold! cousin John Evans & an officer from his Ambulance came along to afternoon tea
and we had quite a roomfull as there were two or three other people here. He looks very well & likes El Arish. I am enclosing a circular which was sent me from the Sydney University Union - if you have any spare photos of mine I would be glad if you would send one along to them, but please - no extract from letters. Today we had a photo of the Ambulance taken & I am sending my film up to Cairo to be developed & hope to get a decent picture from it. I am sending along one or two photos I have taken with my new camera & hope you like them. One of the pictures you may recognize or rather the chief figure in it, who is myself. I really am very stuck for news my dear & don't think I can fill any more pages this time so will conclude there, with much love & a hug from Your loving son, Wilf.
