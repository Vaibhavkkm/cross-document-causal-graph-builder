Text:  Dearest Mother & all at Home  Just a short note to let you  know that I am in the best of health & disposition for  the New Year. We heard the most glorious news  to-day that we will be at the Front in 3 months time.  I can't tell you what a joy I felt on receiving this  glorious news. I can tell you, Mother, all our boys  will give a good account of themselves, as their work  is beautiful & their Gun Drill & Laying, splendid &  we are simply itching to be right in the thick of  the Fight. Since we have been in Camp here, we  have been told that all our Drill has been altered  & today, we started on the new stuff. It is like this,  A battery is ordered into Position, & this is done at  the dead of night & as soon as we get there, we have  to dig the Guns & Wagons into the ground & entirely concealed from the enemy. The ground is banked  up 4 feet high all around the guns & trenches for the  gunners are dug 6 feet deep on each side like this-
ground  2 feet 6 inches wide  big enough for men to  lie down in here  So you see we are quite safe, & this  method was discovered in this war & of  course, the War Office is circulating these  particulars to all our troops. 
We remain in these places for days & even weeks &  during the night, the wagons come up & keep us well supplied with ammunition. In most cases the guns  are so well covered, that grass & other quick growing  stuff is sown on top & it is impossible to detect anything  at 500 yards. The Artillerymen are thus splendidly  protected & thoroughly enjoyed theirselves. Even the  Officers are dug in & telephones are used to each  gun pit. Signalling is entirely done away with.  Sir George Reid visited us yesterday & we  turned out in full force to greet him & he made a  long speech to us & we were afterwards presented  with a pocket knife each & we also got a Tin of  Chocolate which I will send home to you. I am  sending some Post Cards by this mail & hope you  receive them. There is not much to tell you about  as I have written to you every week lately. I got a  letter from Alice Cutler to-day dated 1st November & this  was the date we sailed from Albany, so you see  they don't bustle with the Mail here.  Well Mother dear, I'll now close wishing  all the Compliments of the Season & the best love  to all at home & elsewhere, & an extra ration to  yourself. I remain  Your loving Son  Norman.


Tell Rupert 'I have  plenty of rides on the  little donkeys here, & am going to have a ride on a Camel next  Sunday. If we have our  Photo's taken, I'll send  some home /
 Tell Jack Tilton that  there is plenty of work for  Telephonists in our work  now / & also tell him  that Jack Heywood wishes  to be remembered to him
 
Fred Conradi & I went into  Cairo last night & after a  tremendous feed (of course) we  went shopping & bought singlets  & drawers & all kinds of things so as to keep the Issue Stuff for the Front. I have tons of money  & get paid my 17/6 every week &  I hope you get yours alright  I'll send you some if you  want it, so please let me know
 
This fish is for Rupert  & tell him to put it on  the palm of his hand &  watch it try to jump off  his hand /  Give my love to Floss Robbie  & the boys all wish to be  remembered home
