No. I Aust. Gen. Hospital  or to be correct Zeitoun  August 9th, 1915. 

My dear mother,  Since my arrival here I have  received no letters though I know you would  have written & I am wondering if my letters have  reached you & sincerely hope they have as you  would undoubtedly be anxious otherwise & would  miss explanations as to my whereabouts explained  in one & not in another. The mails appear to go  somewhat erratically from here also - I do not think  that a regular weekly service still exists. By the  way I wish you would send me Auntie Lily's  address in case I should like to write to her or  if by any chance I should go there, though  the latter is highly improbable. Since I am wrote  you I have gone out a little less as it is rather  expensive if one is not careful. I had a game  of tennis on some courts near here last week,  the courts are made of sand watered &  rolled hard & the company who runs them  charges 2/- an hour for the four players  with balls & racquets included  which is really fairly cheap though
the racquets are not of the best. However we managed  to have quite a good game & enjoyed it. Yesterday  afternoon Wesley & I met at Helipolis at the hospital  & had a talk to some of the others then had  afternoon tea & went into the city from whence  we drove in a garry to No TT Hospital at  Ghezirah just over the Nile on the other side  of Cairo. There are 3 bridges over the Nile  & this is near the middle one. It was once  I believe the Sultan's Palace & is a beautiful  building situated not far from those gardens  I described to you & on the very banks  of the Nile. We went there to see Sandy Wilson  who was chief instrument man at Prince Alfred  Hospital just like Wright was at Sydney  & he went away with one of the Field ambulances.  He developed some inflammation in one of  the nasal sinuses & had an operation but  is quite well now. He was out when we went  there first but we met a couple of Nurses  whom I had known at Sydney Hospital  & they told us that Chapman who was  in my year & is also in a Field Ambulance  over here was in hospital. He had had his  tonsils removed & was convalescent so  we talked to him for awhile & then went  along & saw Jack James also a medico who was a couple of years ahead  of us & son of the minister of St. Enochs  at Newtown. He was not so bad at all  just a little off color so we stayed & talked  to him for quite a long time & then we betook  ourselves to the Presbyterian church in Cairo at 6 p.m.  There is a permanent minister there but the congregation  consisted mainly of military people. One fellow  was there with his mother, a medico, who I believe  is an only son & his father is dead so his mother  had to come over too. She must have rather a  slow time I should think unless she has  made some acquaintances. We had a decent  sermon, slow music rather & the usual  national anthem. Then we wanted dinner  so went into a good restaurant called  the "Petrograd" & had a good dinner  which cost us between 4/- & 5/- each.  All the dining places here are situated  in the open without any overhead covering  as it never rains & they almost all have  orchestras. Dinner extends over quite a  long period & after it is finished one sits  & smokes & sips coffee & listens to the orchestra  so it quite constitutes an evenings amusement  especially as it does not usually commence  until 8 o'clock. Just as we were leaving we 
met a couple of N.S. Wales doctors, Frizell  & Moseley & we stayed & talked with them for  a long time, then went for a stroll & came  home. I h am having quite a decent time now  as regards work for I have very little to  do at present since all the troops went away,  but at last have succeeded in getting the  camp moderately clean - I'm pleased to say  that it looks vastly better than when I came  here. I am making strenuous endeavours  to go back to No I Hospital, but have not yet  succeeded, would be very glad to have  some really good medical or surgical work  to do again. Am tired of writing today  my dear & have little more news to tell so  will close with best love to yourself  & all the family from  Your loving son,  Wilf.
