August 31st, 1914. At Sea off Samoa  We arrived off the town of Apia  Samoa yesterday morning, I sent  in a flag of truce and summoned the  foreman to surrender to a superior force  and he did so. I found that there  were no mines or guns so landed  the men and took possession of the  place hauled down the German flag  and hoisted our own. Everything sailed for Suva with the Montcals and "Melbourne". The Colonel of the  New Zealand troops is left in  charge of the Island as Administrator  We shall probably arrive at Suva  on the 2nd of September, coal, and  then start off for another expedition  The German cruisers have disappeared  entirely for the present.  Suva. Fiji.

Patey,
