 Had 7 sick horses at the sick horse parade, all suffering from swelling in the hind legs Purpura haemorrhagia. Capt Whitfield thinks the complaint is largely due to the intense suns heat on the  horses spines & advocates the placing of a covering over their backs. The horses throughout the camp are afflicted. One of the ASC horses attached to me has been returned from the V. hospital as incurable from the same complaint. The new horses which I drew from [[Lemount?]] depot as Wardien on 3.6.15 to replace my losses since I left Mena (4) are Canadian horses they are very good & look well.- I had a look round and over a windmill used for grinding barley on Friday The mill is about 35 ft. or rather the sails are, The mill room building is about 20 ft high. A 14 inch square shaft runs through near the top a 6ft driving wheel (wooden cogs)
connects with a perpendicular shaft on  a wheel that revolves turning the grinding stones. It seemed to work very well & took little wind to drive it.
