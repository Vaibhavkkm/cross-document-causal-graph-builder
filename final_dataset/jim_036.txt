Dear Perce,
Just a line to let you know I have
not forgotten all about you. How are you
getting on at school this year? I suppose
you have started football by this time. The
weather here is just the thing for football, but
it so hard to play on account of the ground
being sandy. We have had two matches and
have won one of them. I got a tooth broken
in the first and a tooth through my lip
the second. Are you captain of your form
team again this year? Kirkwood of Essendon
is in my camp and enjoys his kick. Is
there a School "Record" out yet. Don't forget
to send one along to me. Mr Heathcote
is in this camp now but I have not been
lucky enough to strike him yet. He came
from Egypt about 12 days after me. Jimmy
Haddow is now a 2nd Lieut. and is with the 6th Batt.
I think Billy Bruce is still at the Canal, but I
am not certain. I had a letter from Les a  few days ago. I was very glad to hear of him
again. Don't forget to write now and then. 
Your brother,
Jim
{P.S. Do you still forget
your lunch sometimes?}
