Leadership in the First World War

The First World War("https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/first-world-war") was fought on a vast scale and raised unprecedented challenges for the leaders of the combatant nations.
The political leaders were responsible for the decision to go to war, and for deciding what war aims to pursue. The horrific casualties sustained early in the war meant that none of them could consider accepting a peace without victory. They were forced to oversee ever-increasing social and industrial mobilisation to support the war, and to mortgage the financial future of their countries to pay for it.
In Britain and France democratic control was maintained over the war. In Britain, in contrast to his predecessor Herbert Henry Asquith("https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/a-short-guide-to-h-h-asquiths-first-world-war"), Prime Minister David Lloyd George("https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/who-was-david-lloyd-george") directed  Britain’s war effort through a relatively small War Cabinet. He also drafted in experts from the world of commerce and industry when necessary. Meanwhile in the Central Powers the Army increasingly dominated, extending its powers into the civil domain.

The British Government in the First World War
In contrast to his predecessor as Prime Minister, Herbert Henry Asquith, David Lloyd George directed Britain’s war effort through a relatively small War Cabinet. He also drafted in experts from the world of commerce and industry when necessary.

Military leaders were faced with the problem of overcoming the power of modern weaponry, which drove their armies to seek the shelter of entrenchments. By 1918 they had developed suitable tactics and were plentifully equipped. Nevertheless, the nature of industrial warfare meant that, whether in attack or defence, victory or defeat, they had to justify a heavy loss of life.

David Lloyd George was British Chancellor of the Exchequer during H H Asquith’s pre-war Liberal government. Following the outbreak of the First World War("https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/first-world-war") in August 1914, he displayed great competence as Chancellor but became disillusioned with Asquith's leadership.
In May 1915, following the formation of the coalition government, Lloyd George was appointed head of the newly created Ministry of Munitions. His enterprise and appreciation of the importance of good labour relations eventually led to hugely improved armaments production.
Politically ambitious, especially after becoming Secretary of State for War in June 1916, Lloyd George, with Conservative support, edged Asquith from power. He became Prime Minister in December 1916.

Herbert Henry Asquith (1852-1928) was Prime Minister of Great Britain between 1908 and 1916.
His pre-war liberal government laid the foundations of today's welfare state introducing pensions and unemployment insurance. Social reforms and the re-armament of the Royal Navy, necessitated an increase in tax which provoked a clash with the House of Lords.

Although convinced of the legitimacy of Britain's declaration of war against Germany in 1914, Asquith was reluctant immediately to extend government power to create an economy suited to fight an industrial war on a vast scale.
His 'business as usual' approach was accompanied by a process of decision-making in which Asquith deliberately and respectfully acknowledged the expertise of his military commanders.
In May 1915, after reports of munitions’ shortages on the Western Front, squabbles between Lord Fisher and Winston Churchill at the Admiralty, and failures at Gallipoli("https://www.iwm.org.uk/search/stories?query=&filters%5Bsm_topic_name%5D%5BGallipoli%5D=on"), Asquith was forced into a coalition government with the Conservatives.
But he remained the focal point for blame for all military, naval and policy setbacks. He was increasingly sidelined in strategic decision-making and ultimately outmanoeuvred by Lloyd George("https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/who-was-david-lloyd-george").
Asquith resigned as Prime Minister on 5 December 1916.
