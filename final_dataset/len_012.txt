 Have been unable to send this letter away & been carrying it in my pocket. Have a chance now & will take it. We are right in the thick of things again & a choice spot this is. It's been raining for days & days & this  place is absolutely indescribable. It is quite  common to see men hopelessly bogged, & have to be pulled out by their mates - you can imagine (to a slight degree) what it is like hauling & carrying the supplies & ammunition for an immense army through this stuff. Not one of us has been dry for at least a  week, & there is no prospect of getting dry until we are relieved & get back to rest. All my luggage is carried in a small haversack (about the size of the ordinary school boy's bag) & one's overcoat pockets, so it doesnt allow of a very extensive wardrobe - as a  matter of fact two pairs of socks, a h'chief, razor, brush, toothbrush, & piece of soap, with
a mug, plate & knife & fork completes the furniture. The thought of even having a bath again makes me almost burst into tears, Ten days now since I have had any of my clothes off, & the last seven days of it in a constant bath of glutinous mud. I sometimes wonder if it will ever come off. I feel as fit as a fiddle - certainly outside life suits me. The conditions here are really just about as rotten as they could be, it is perishingly cold as well but I don't think I ever felt better. There is extraordinarily little sickness amongst the men too. Dr Falkner will be disgusted to know that I smoke morning noon & night - I don't think its tobacco though - just various  brands of straw. It's mightily comforting though. Give my love to Pater - will write to him as soon as I get out of this hole Much for your dear old self from yr loving son R.L.H. love to dear old Nell
