Dearest Mother and Father,
I do not know whether there is a mail
to Australia before next month, but as
letters are collected as usual, perhaps it
is just as well to write each week.
Your letter of 15/5/16 has just come to
hand, also a letter and card from
Ruby, a card from Auntie Kate, and
two letters from Harry. I am still
awaiting a letter from Les. I cannot
understand why his letters are delayed,
as I am sure he is writing each week.
I am glad my letters from France
reached you alright. I thought you
would know I was in France before
your received my letter.
So far I have received three out
of the five parcels you have sent. The
two containing socks are still on the
way. The only papers to arrive so far
are several Age's and Argus's, but I see
a good few papers nevertheless. At present we are billeted in a
farmhouse, - in the barn attached thereto,
I should say. We enjoy a very
comfortable bed at present, - plenty of
clean straw. The people are very kind
and obliging. The farm has the usual
thatched roof and is on a typical
muddy road of Northern France. The
land about here is very fertile and
both crops and gardens are looking
splendid. The family at present
consists of grandmother, father, mother
and two grown up daughters. The
latter work from morning till night
dressmaking. I do not profess to be
a judge of sewing &c, but I
certainly think their work is most
beautiful. Both speak a little English
and are anxious to improve themselves,
so I seized the opportunity of conversing
with them now and then so as to
learn more French. They speak and work at high speed (at the same time).
I think I am making good headway
at French now, under such able tuition.
The news of the Combined French
and British advance is very satisfactory
and the Germans must be feeling the
pressure on all the fronts just now.
Let us hope they will soon have
felt the full weight of England
and her hard punch.
There is very little news to tell you
this time, so I must adjourn till
next week.
Your affectionate son,
Jim
P.S. I am sending some PIC's
to Perce, Ruby and Gertie.
