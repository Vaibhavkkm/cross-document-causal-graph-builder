Dear Sir Just a few lines to let you know how I am getting on. I have been up & walking about for two weeks now but my knee it not quite right yet as I cannot bend it as I should & if I sit in one position for long it gives me awful pain but it is not swollen. I am in a very nice hospital & Mrs Birdwood comes & sees me every day I had the job of faning her at the last Dance they had at the Y.M.C.A. which are very good here giving concerts every other night & cinema, Col Newmarsh has been twice to see me a told me he has heard from you sir. I have of course made myself useful in the ward assisting the sister etc also at the No 2 General
where I was at first. I was very pleased to see our Chief has been made full General as all the boys here call him Dad & they are all Daddy's boys to there own estimation & nobody dare say a word against him not even the lads who have come down here from Gen Byng front I think this is all for now Sir except that I am afraid I shall not be over on Xmas leave unless the war finishes or something very lucky happens I now close wishing you the best of health & good luck Sir I remain your obediant Servant Pte Harold Jackson 
Would you kindly remember. me to Sgt Abbott & all the Club boys Sir with my best wishes
