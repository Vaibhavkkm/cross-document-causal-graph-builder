Text:   Dear Father & Mother,-  During the past few days  I have recd two cables - both from [[Armitage]] &dealing with George's departure. The first one is from you I  think saying G. leaves at end of Feb, &the other is  from Perth - from G. himself I presume, saying he  expects to be in Eng. in 8 weeks - tho as the  censor cut out the date of sending - I am not  able to gauge exactly the date of his arrival  I got my Sp Leave to  visit England - (commencing tomorrow) but I will  not take it now, &am writing in asking them to  hold it over for 4 weeks or so - &thus meet him.  I hope this can be managed for I have sacrificed  my ordinary leave - &it will take some shrewd  calculations to manage so as to see him during the  first few days of his arrival &before joining his ship,  &, it will require an immense amt of luck too.  It takes a [[?]] from London 4 days to reach the  Battn, &as it took 9 days to get a reply from  Div. H.Q re my leave, two days from here to  Havre, &then the chance of being held up there  by a 'closed' Channel - you can see I'll have  to be very lucky to meet him O.K.
However I'm trusting to luck - I generally manage to get along somehow. so I don't anticipate the possibility of not seeing him. There's a vacancy for a Major in our Battn. &Seager, Moule, &myself is the order of seniority Seager is somewhat of a 'dud' just now, and is going to be superseded - Moule is Qrmaster, &as such can only take an hon. appointment - that leaves me next. & I've been told unofficially by Murray Fowler - (Adj. now) that my papers are "written up". I hope I am not promoted. Seager is a bit of a muggins in some respect - but he has guts anyhow. He is a friend of mine too, & was superseded by Loutit - (now 2nd in Com) not long ago, - so he would think we had him set  &would be bitter about it.  The O.C. has had to interview him about his Co., & Seager is properly down to things just now I don't want to be promoted if it makes S, sore - I would rather do without it, - also it seems farcical to make a youngster like me have a position that among Regulars is only filled by a man of 35 or 40. I hope I don't get it:- as tho I'm prepared to accept the responsibility if necessary - I don't want either the rank or the pay. I think the AIF. is
overpaid already, especially the Caps. & Majors. I think it would be better if they knocked off some of our pay & gave extra to the N.C.Os - especially the L.Cpl. who only gets the same as a private. I'm not promoted yet - so I'm happy &content. Fritz seems to be giving a fair amount of trouble up about Bapaume, but in a few days he will get a solid bump, &will have to fall back towards Cambrai at a tremendous rate - altho we don't expect him to go much further back. This retirement is one of the benefits we have reaped after worrying him all the winter, and it is a reward to our boys who are following Fritz up for the last half of his retirement March winds here are 'Some' winds - knifey and strong. I've only experienced one &that's enough. Occasionally snow falls, but we have plenty of MUD- getting just the opposite extreme to the dry sand of Egypt - just to make the happy mean. No more news just now - I'm as fit as a fiddle, &sincerely hope you are all quite well too. Will write again in a day or so - &will now close with very much love &best of all good wishes to you for all sorts of good luck, prosperity &good health- &much love to yourselves from Your loving son, Rollo.
