Australian Red Cross Society (A.R.C.S) Red Cross Rest Room S. S. Aeneas. 3. 2. 1919.  My dear mother, Just a few lines to say that we are quarantined at Melbourne for 3 days on account of a supposed case of influenza we had a week ago. After that we don't know what will happen - it finishes on Wednesday morning. The previous boats discharged their folk at Melbourne - the whole lot - for what reason I don't know as there is sure to be further quarantine on the N.S.W border in that case. Australia at present makes me disgusted - the silly way they all appear to be going on. I will tell you further when I know more. One rumor is that we are to be quarantined for a week at Broadmeadows camp Melbourne after leaving the boat, I am well & still growing fat & bald Lots of love from Your loving son Wilf.
