1ST ANZAC CORPS. B.E.F., FRANCE. 25 March 1918 (*Flight to France*) 1918 My own darlingest, little sweetheart, I did think it was so awfully sweet & brave of you to see me off as you did & I hated leaving you like that with such an anxious time for [[?]] everyone. I landed quite successfully - just 1 hour & 5 minutes!  It wasn't though what you could describe as a very pleasant voyage over & the pilot called it a very "bumpy" one.  It was blowing much harder than you would think, as the wind seemed to increase in strength as time went on. We followed the coast up to Folkestone & then struck across the Channel where we went to about 4000 feet. You never saw such a curious sight as it was from there. Down below it seemed to be a fairly cloudy day, but at 4000 we had got above all the clouds which lay in one mass of white billows  below us absolutely covering the whole of the land. In the
middle of the Channel there was a clear belt & one could see ships like small specks moving about below one. Then when we got to France again the whole country was under cloud.  We struck the coast at Cap Grisnez & worked up to Bologne & then turned inland. We then had of course to come down below the cloud, but it was impossible to avoid them altogether, so had to keep falling & rising as we got to belts of them - which was uncomfortable.  While of course the wind roared the whole time. I was doubtful at one time if we should be able to strike the exact aerdrome we wanted, but my pilot brought us along
capitally & we made a most excellent landing without a bump of any sort a bit before 2.   McGuigan met me shortly after with the car & we came along to my Corps H.Q. I am sorry to say one of the beautiful towers of the town where I landed has been destroyed during my absence by a big shell & the  fine organ of the Church near it also destroyed. It was an old tower of [[French?]] architecture
& I had hoped would have survived. No orders yet for us to leave here, but some of my troops have gone, so you may see references to Australians elsewhere
which will not necessarily mean that I am with them.  Chris [[very?]] well indeed & very happy.  He tells me he left that blanket "flea-bag" in a suit case with his initials on it!  I fancy it will be one of those in the passage. In the mean time I took his green canvas valise to A.I.F. H.Q. thinking I should be able to get his blankets from the [[?]]. Now that this is not the case the valise may just as well stay there & if you'd remember it will you send the blankets up to Genl Griffiths by 
the first chance you get she can  then send them over in the valise.  No more news about Chris going to Rouen.   I expect my letter went astray.   Will you please be sure to tell Mrs   Buckley how really sorry I am not to   have seen her this time & tell her it   was only on the Tuesday mnig & this being that   I was in London at all then only for about   an hour! While I had meant to    see her when we were down for a few 
days.  I expect  you will have written a line to Genl. Howse. All my love  to you my own darling little wife. You really are the best little woman in the world.  Ever your very loving old, Will
