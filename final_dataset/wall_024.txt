In The Trenches Somewhere in France  Dear Mum Well I hope this finds you well & having a good time as this leaves me well & having a very fair time. I was going to England on my leave on June the second. But I volunteered to go on a raiding party & I have been picked & I wouldn't miss that for anything. We are going to go into the German Trenches and surprise them or else bomb them out. It will be a fairly risky job but I think that we can carry it out alright at anyrate we can try. If I get in & get some souvenirs I will send you home a German Helmet, eh what! We are going to capture and bring back what we can. The Germans made a raid on our Trenches down at the 20th Batt. & killed or wounded a hundred men. so I may assure we wont take no prisoners. How is Bob getting on? & has he told you anything yet. Well mum I think the best thing he can do is to enlist.
Perhaps it would have been much better had he done it long ago & come away with me. he would have been much better off don't you think. We have been having great weather lately quite like Australian weather as the French call it. Tray Bon. which means very good. The Germans bombarded the town of Armentier this afternoon but I don't think that there was much damage done. By jove won't we give them one for bobbing when we start to advance. I'll bet that we go straight through. Well mum I hope you are all well at home & love to you all from your Loving Son Wally, xxxxxx
