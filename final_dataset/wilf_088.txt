24.4.1917 My dear mother, Much has happened since I last wrote  you & we have had rather a strenuous time. It is now about nine days since we left our last bivouac & since then we have been constantly moving & living in the open. We have settled down again now though I can’t  say we are very comfy, as we have very little stuff  with us for shelters & it is very windy & exceedingly dusty  & very hot. Flies have come along again & are making a nuisance of themselves. We left our old camp near the sea the day after I last wrote & moved out towards the Turks but not very much fighting took place on the first day or two, on our part of the line though I believe there was a good deal on our left. On the third day however the main attack was made & it was an exceedingly fierce scrap. I was placed in charge of the dressing station for the whole of our division about two miles back from the main firing line & as I did not go up with the sandcarts I was exposed to comparatively little risk. We put up a couple of tents & a Red Cross flag collected some wood from an old house near by, had a fire made & some hot tea & cocoa ready. We then laid out our dressings & instruments & were ready. After making tea for ourselves & having some breakfast the wounded commenced to roll in & we were kept busy. They were brought back  in sandcarts & then put in our tents, dressed & given hot drinks & Morphia if necessary  & then sent on by more sandcarts, motor Ambulances & the sitting cases on horse  limbers & anything which came along. Later on in the day they came in so fast that we could hardly cope with them. as I was the only medico there & had only about half a dozen assistants but we worked  on as hard as we could. Then we had difficulty in getting enough transport to take them back further & accumulated numbers in our station However by dint of requisitioning everything  which came along the road we eventually cleared by 9.30 p.m. & came away ourselves. Some officers I know well & am very fond of were hit & I hated to see them there - I never seem to hate war so much as when I see fine fellows getting bowled over. The gun fire was particularly heavy that day, shrapnel & high explosive were bursting all day long. The Turks had one big gun which was firing constantly & seeking for one of  our batteries & it was one succession of huge explosions when these shells crashed on the hollow near these batteries. It looked as if they were going to shell us once but they didn't as I fancy they sighted the flag -each shell came closer along the track until they were within about 100 yards & then they stopped. I think in the front line of the fighting it was one of the most furious days we have had as the rifle & machine  gun fire was intense & the shelling very severe. Of the numbers of our casualties I cannot speak but as the whole of our division was passing through my hands I can say without divulging anything that I have never had to deal with so many before The Turks also must have suffered very heavily. I brought the last of our wounded back to the next station & then back to the next & returned again to xxx a spot where I had to meet the rest of the Ambulance arriving there early in the morning. I moved out again early next morning with the Brigade & we were expecting an attack from the Turks that night or early next morning but none came & I was not very sorry as we were all very tired. We were relieved next evening & came back a mile or two to camp & thence back to this spot which is a vile place. All the earth  soon cuts up to a fine floury powder which blows everywhere & when we take our horses to water 3 miles away we travel the whole time in a cloud of this beastly stuff. Some Turkish prisoners I saw this time were a very well fed & clothed lot - I fancy the tales we hear of Turkey starving are rather imaginary. Matters appear to be progressing well in France & I sincerely hope they continue to do so, as I want the beastly old war to end up as quickly as possible. All these Bedouin huts are as full as full can be of fleas & the Colonel incautiously entered one to look round one day & there he looked down at his foot & saw not one flea but his foot covered with hundreds of fleas. Another officer caught some too in the same way & they picked & picked  them off & still they came & of course we got them too & every night during the operation they worried us as we had no change of clothes  & couldn't wash them. However I’m changed & clean again now or as clean as the dust will allow me to be. You would have laughed though to see us hunting for these fleas & cursing volubly at the wretches when they spoilt our rest when we were dog tired. No more news this time my dear hope it will be better next & we are a bit more settled with love to all & a double share to mother from Your loving son Wilf.
