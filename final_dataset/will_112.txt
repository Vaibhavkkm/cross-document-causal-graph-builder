4 Avenue  Marceau November 22, 1917,  Dear General Birdwood, My husband writes about the honour which has just been conferred upon you I am so glad and have come to congratulate  you! Are you not coming to Paris soon, I would so like to see you again, that evening at La Motte au Bois passed by so quickly, do let me know if you come - My husband is always at Cassel but doesn't know if he will be there long, all the others having gone to Italy - It was a pleasure to read the papers this morning, it did ones heart good the British are distinguishing themselves everywhere
I hope you are at rest for awhile as we say in French "Chacun son tour", I wonder if you are near Amiens or Abbeville, as I sometimes go to either of those places. Let me tell you again, dear General Birdwood, how glad I am you received the recompense for your merits and believe me yours very sincerely, C'tessa Gabriel de Muny
