14th November 1917  My dear General.   Many I tender you the very sincere good wishes of the Brigade on the promotion announced today. To these I feel bound to add our very great apprehension lest you be called away to another command, and in this you will see that we stand self convicted of selfishness - yet quite unashamed & hopeful.  Believe me Yours very sincerely J.Gellibrand
