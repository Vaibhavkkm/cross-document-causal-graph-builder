Mon. Dec. 31, 1917
Weather: coldest day of the year Health: my cold is a little worse
Up at 8:00 but doze and talk and lie in bed until nearly 11. Aaron calls up to say that Tom and Abe have not come to work and that Marshall wants to go home, he too being so cold that he sits on radiator. This frightens and disappoints Leah and me greatly. We debate for a long time whether we should go to shop at all. Decide to go for a short while and to ask Felix and Max to lunch with us. Rebekah calls up just as we are about to leave and interferes with our plans. To ferry for 12:30 boat. Leah suffers from cold. In shop at 1:50. Most dismal sight. No one there but Aaron and he with overcoat on and teeth chattering is a pitiful sight to behold. It is very cold in shop in spite of steam up. Willetts and Tom up. I do a little work and read a long lecture to Aaron about lost motions and good methods and send him home at three. To Elm Tree Tea Room for waffles and tea which are good and make us warm. Go to see Felix and Max and spend a most pleasant hour and a half. Weigh myself and find that I have gained about three pounds since I have been in the Army. Look for something to give Mama for present but cannot find anything suitable. Home at 7 and walk into a cold, half lit house. No gas, not much coal. A good supper, after which I sit by the fire with Leah on my lap and talk scandal, war and peace. Mama has grown accustomed to my being a soldier. We leave for home and 10:30 boat. Keep warm all the way. Get to bed just in time to hear whistles and church bells ring out old year and ring in the new. A year of hardships and sorrows intermingled with happiness has passed. Our most fervent please to God to grant us a year of happiness and peace and a normal baby.
