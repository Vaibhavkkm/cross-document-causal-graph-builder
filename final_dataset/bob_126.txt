 My dear Mum, Have just come out of the line again for a short period while on the way out ran into Nana who was going in He was looking splendid had not seen him for some months so we had a good yarn naturally he had a great time in London on leave bye the bye am expecting mine again shortly it is five months 
nearly since my last Am thinking of spending this one in Paris and the South of France & yet I do not know  London is a wonderful place it fascinates me I know it more or less and know where to go and how to have a really good time there. Had a beautiful bath this morning the first for ten days also last night was the first time my clothes have been off for ten days So you can imagine how bucked up I am feeling just at present. Still one 
is used to it all these days yet there seems to be no ending to this business yet we make the most of things and on the whole we have a really good time. Went to a show last night the Division run called the Smart Set with the 13th Band in attendance it was really excellent & very clever in parts Amy Castles brother belongs to them he has a bosca tenor voice among other things he sang that piece from "Rigoletto" Fair Shines the Moon etc in Italian it was great quite on a par with McCormack. All the performers in the show are in 
the A.I.F 4th Div. it is rumoured they are going to London to show also our band it would be a great Advt. Have just been out with their football team who are training for a big match next Saturday but the weather is so rotten over here at this time of the year there is not much pleasure in sport the only pastime seems to be Bridge & poker both of which we play a lot. No more news at present lots of love to all, Bob.
