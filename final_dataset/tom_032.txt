Marseilles, 21.05.1916,

My dear Miss Champion, I'm sorry not to have answered your letter by the last mail. I only got it about a week ago, I do wish I could tell you more of your man, I would willingly if I could, only 85 men came into my ward that day & I was the only sister in it, the Dr and four Orderlies and I had tolook after all those men they came straight from the shore to us tho, and your man came on 
in his uniform, and was washed and put into a pair of light coloured Pyjamas - he was in a swinging cot, & it was properly made up with sheets and white Blankets, I told you before I think he  was operated on, and really I don't think he had very  much pain - I'm more than sorry for you, and I wish I could do more for you, please try and understand, that tho I do remember him perfectly there were was so much to do and it was all very terrible We were in the midst of all the battle ships and the shots & shell were all round us, the men were more than fine, & I feel proud to belong to the same nation - Itoo have a man in the firing line and he is big and fair - and I do understand what your  feelings are- Yours Sincerely. Katherine Porter
