Will continue my letter this fine warm evening. The weather has been fine almost
all week, and we are all developing a beautiful coat of tan and sunburn. Again I wish I
had my campaign hat.
I will probably leave here in a day or two for a point nearer the front and on
detached service. I do not know just what the facilities will be for mailing letters when I
am away from the company, so if there is an interruption in my correspondence, do not
be worried.
The city near which we are billeted contains the General Headquarters of the
A.E.F. I was enabled to go into town last night because of my Masonic affiliations. All
the Masons stationed here were given passes last night, and we were also allowed to use
two of the trucks to take us in. We attended an informal meeting of the Army Masons
stationed in this vicinity, and I spent one of the most enjoyable evenings since I have
been in the service. We met in one of the rooms of the YMCA hut, and I got acquainted
with quite a few Illinois men who are stationed at G.H.Q.
Today we had our first regimental review, and I marched behind the colors and
regiment standard for the first time. It is very seldom that one sees a flag of any kind in
connection with troops on active service.
From The Story of the First Gas Regiment: “The most striking celebration of our
new unity as a regiment was given in a review of The 30th held by Colonel Fries on May
3 at the Gas Experimental Field – a day when hardly a man could help feeling, with
something of a thrill, what the past seven months had seen achieved and what the next
seven might hold in store. And from then on a schedule of steady training was set in
operation…for D by instruction for NCOs and later for all the men, in Stokes mortars and
projectors. Meantime, in the Regimental and Battalion Headquarters, the task was being
planned and pressed of getting the 30th ready for front-line warfare.”
