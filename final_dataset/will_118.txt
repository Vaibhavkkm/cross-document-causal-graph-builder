Thursday  6 December 1917     Dear General,  Many thanks for your extremely kind letter which I shall gum into my diary! - I can assure you it was a real pleasure to do anything for your comfort and I only hope that when you are over again you will - if it is possible (which I know may not be the case) - give me a little notice so that we can do better 
for you :- On Mr Longs  behalf I went down to receive you at Charing Cross on the Sunday but I found you had arrived unexpectedly earlier in the day :-  I can understand your mens devotion for you when I, a middle aged politician fell under your spell on that (to me) memorable Monday the 12 March last at Hennencourt Chateau  Yours Ever, William Bull.

To: General Sir William Birdwood
