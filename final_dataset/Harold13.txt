TRIP  From Egypt to France  1
 Dear Father & Mother -
It is nearly a fortnight since I last wrote, but owing to all mails out and in being stopped indefinitely, it has perhaps been hardly worth writing, even if circumstances had
allowed us time to write letters. Just a fortnight ago today our battn was
started off in the new campaign, and as a unit was
pulled out of the front line.  I finished up on the extreme,
right (near L.[[?]]) & had a front of nearly 4 miles. [[?]]
did [[Hi.?]] broke it with the extra work he had to do there,
the remnant was sent to me, & fine big upstanding dark
bay mare - full of pace & life, I've decided to stick
her.
About a week ago we were relieved, my boys had
to march about 13 miles to the Battn [[raid?]] [[?]], & there we
were a few miles from the Canal.  Next day we went for
a 10 mile march on the road to get their feet steady.
& then next day we packed up & proceeded to [[?]] to entrain.  We
bivouaced at the station that night. Left eary next
morning for Alex, one of the longest troop train journey I have ever done, & we embarked later the same day.  Next
morning early we pushed out &have now been out 2 days.
The boys were nearly flagged out for during the past 3
weeks they had had an extremely rough time, and many
of them nearly broke down.  I am very glad to [[see?]]

the guts they showed then & on the desert marches. it did
us good to see each platoon in step, the beat & their
singing &marching chant - well it was great.
Each platoon has a singster - singing made these
marches much easier.  The night we took the road to
the Canal, & out of the dismal desert well - the boys
were in tremendous high spirits simply yelled their
songs, made the pace [[t/c?]]  - so that we got into the 
station about an hour earlier than expected - after about
4 miles of marching.
I've had to leave Harmony in Egypt.  I am sorry to
say. He got dysentery on top of the desert march & was
sent straight to Hospital.  He was very ill, so bad
that he was taken away without the usual red tape [[ferma?]]
& ordinary sick casualties - Harmony - on the day we
left we got news that he was about again, but not
well enough to come with us.  He should join us in 2-
or 3 weeks time - and I am keeping his place open in
the Company.
Our sea trip so far is most delightful - in this crowded
but could be far worse, of course the usual precautions
against [[?]] are adopted, life-[[boats?]] (or [["kalos"?]]
as we boys quickly dubbed them) being generally warm,
though it is extremely uncomfortable.  The ship is
fine, nice bright.  The weather is very pleasant. You

Our motto re Egypt & Sinai Prini is "no Regrets"
and a good one it is. (I will write more later)
(June 17th 16) It is marvellous the roudabout ways
it takes nowadays to cross the Medit. I believe
this N. W. sends countless instructions to transports,
& very few minor detailing the course to be followed.
Also (as there are about 5 ships in the convoy) all
change their courses everyfive or six hundred yds
so that it would be hard for a torpedo [[?]] to make anything take accurate calculations from a [[?]] as to [[?]] rate, course, &c. we order to hit in. We passed around the N. of  Crete, - a miserable mountainous island it [[locked?]]  In fact - anything pertainng to Greece is miserable, dirty, untidy, & dammed.  the danger now (Adriatic) is not [[?]] - much from [[?]] as from minefields - undubtedly the dammed Greeks had a hand in laying there, & if Greece is the [[?]] [[?]] country to the death with [[?]] [[?]] the Aussies have a hand in dealing it out. The day before we left the Canal [[?]] a nice, [[panel?]] from [[?]] - every article [[?]] was accepted

The latter is a real factor here - 3 gas alarms last week & several casualties too - on one occasion travelled over 10 miles Artillery & aerial torpedoes kick up hell's delight, & at night machine guns bark till artillery shut them up. The country is low lying, trenches impossible, so only breastworks possible.  I've seen Coffey & Minagall, & am intending to visit the front to see Weir, Giles &c. in a day or two. Well - I'm dog-tired so will close with best of all good wishes, much love, & hopes you are as well as Rollo.
