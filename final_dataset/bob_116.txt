 Dear Mick, Have just received a nice   long letter from you dated 17th Aug  where it has been goodness only  knows however better late than never  Sorry to hear they plucked you in   your exam as you say they must  have had a rough night or  something. never mind you will  club the next one all right  Had rather a good day yesterday  went with our football team  about 20 miles from here to  some some Australian Flying Corps  chaps camp They gave us a great day of course they got a   big towling up at Football but  we have some team these days  and hope to win the Cup  again this year our first competition  match takes place next Saturday  against the M.G. Coy everyone is   very keen. The Flying Corp chaps  are very comfortable a fine mess  and bar nice huts to live in  etc they showed us. all the   machines etc and promised to  take me up one day the  whole day was very interesting.  Have been playing a lot of  bridge lately nearly every night 
we have some great games at  times usual stakes 1 Franc per  100 it just makes a nice  time game Big Brigade sports coming  off very soon now very busy  training musketry etc in connection  with same the programme is   most interesting. I shall save  it for you. We are all feeling  much better for the quiet rest we  are having here in this qu little  village if the weather was only  decent it would be fine but  it blows raining and is cold always  mud & mud. one gets very full  of it all. Have not seen Nana for quite   a long while but think he   is quite all right He is  almost 15 Kilo's from here but  have not had an opportunity  of looking him up yet. shall   take a ride over one of these   days Well old cock news very  scarce still going strong plenty  of hard fighting to do yet  by the look of things but expect  we will get home some day in  the next ten years if they do  not kill us love to all,  Bob
