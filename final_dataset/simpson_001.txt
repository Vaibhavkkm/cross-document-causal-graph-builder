01.03.1914  S.S. Yankalilla  Sydney     Dear Mother  Just a line to let you know - that  I am still alive and kicking I wrote  you a letter a couple of months and  I sent you three pound I expect that  you have got it by now Well Mother  I had a row with the chief on the  the Tarcoola and I finished up  and I was out of work for three  weeks before I joined this one  You remember about that chap  named Jackson you know his  his mother he is a bricklayer  well he was working in Port  Pirie but he could not stand the  heal he was working on a new  hall that they are building in  Pirie so that he turned the job in  and I got him a job on this ship  I am on, he got a job trimming  he is trimming to me for we are  on watch together I dont think  that he will follow this game  up for he says that it is a
terrible lot heavier work than  bricklaying Now Mother I am  sending you a P.O. for three quid  It is four year since I left home  How the time does fly. but if  I can hang this ship down for  a twelve month I will have a run  home I am beggining to get tired   of this country I think that I  would be just as well sailing  out of home for the money is  getting bigger at home and the   money shark goes out here Well  I think that this is all I have   to say except that I am keeping  well  and I hope that you and  an Annie are keeping the same  so with love to you and Annie  I remain  Your Loving Son  Jack
