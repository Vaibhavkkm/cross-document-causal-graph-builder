12.10.15.  Letter to Harry re Notes - drawings tc. Sydney -  Emden - Kaiser Bill tc. — & little tales told  about Jacko 

October 21st 1915  A Surprise Mail reached us & letters Sept 8th recd.  We are still here - a real "Cinderella Brigade"  & G.O.C. commanding Division away too  "Maclagon's Circus" we were dubbed when we left  Lemnos - & it has certainly pitched its tent for  a considerable time in this town.  Balkans are very complicated just now, &  we may take a hand there later. Tino & the  Greeks are wobbly but I believe there's a  strong pro British feeling in Greece. If England  will only send us more men & ships we can get  through this job O.K. It may be costly - but  'faint heart never won any sugar plums'. It's  no good making a fuss now over the mess that  has been made - that can wait - what should  be done is a determined strong push, without  pausing to count up losses tc. - & we'd be through  this show in 3 weeks, & able to get elsewhere.  If Serbia can only hold out against Mackensen,  & his hordes - & Italy joins in with all her  might things should then go merrily for us on  all sides - but of course that if keeps stiff. Rollo
