London 23 11/1917.
My dear Sir William. It was indeed kind of you to have sent me such a nice farewell letter, believe me Sir, I appreciate it very highly. During the long period that I have been under your command I have made many sterling friends and gone through some very stir exciting times. After such a length one must necessarily have many deep regrets at the breaking of the connections even if only for the time being. I shall be leaving London to morrow & hope to embank for Australia immediately.
The rest will I feel sure fix me up and I shall come back fit and well and quite able to carry on for another period, by that time there will, I feel sure, be others who are deserving of a spell and maybe I could relieve one of these. I was delighted to see that you had been given promotion. May I offer my hearty congratulations. We Australians feel honoured at this recognition of your efforts, truly we feel that you are part of us and are all unanimous in their pleasure. I trust that this step will not mean your separation from the force that you have brought into being
and whose successes have all been inspired by your efforts. I wish to thank you very much Sir for your many kindnesses to me during the last three years and also your kindness and thoughtfullness to my men, this latter I have appreciated as much as anything else. I feel your successes will continue and I trust you will be long spared to guard the destiny of the A.I.F. Yours very sincerely, J.C.Robertson
