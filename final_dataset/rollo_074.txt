First comes reconnaissance by aeroplanes photos are taken of Fritz lines & a certain section AB is selected - about 120 yds. Our people are secret and complete Then at pre-arranged time all our Artillery opens up a heavy fire from C to D - and after a hot spell - concentrate on AB giving it hot hell & brimstone. During this period our raiders  have crept out (blackened & dressed as described) - sneaked across No Man's Land till they are close to the wire which our fire is smashing open. After a few minutes of Dante's Inferno - this curtain fire is lifted & extended mighty to C E F D.  This prevents any reinforcements coming from the flanks - or from X. Directly our fire lifts our boys hop in - scupper the Huns & scuttle off with any prisoners, badges &c. to our own trenches.  It is the back track that brings our casualties as the Enemy watches out from the flanks at C.D  - & with a cross fire from machine guns - & Fritz own barrage - things are less safe than they might be - so you may guess no one lingers on the back trip. These raids are great; they keep up our morale, & scare blue snakes out of Fritz. - keep us active,  & suit our boys to a T.
