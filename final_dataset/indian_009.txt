Letter from London Regiment
From a Sergeant in the 1/3 London Regiment to a friend in London (Dated 22/10/15). “….the Indians. We get on fine with them. They are a decent lot the ones that are with us, but some of the regiments are not up to much, refuse to go over the top in a charge. The ones we have got here are the Garhwalis and Gurkhas. They are the chaps as long as a white soldier is going to be there, they fight like tigers.”
