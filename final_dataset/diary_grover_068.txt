Notes.

1 Kate Wills provided this detail: 'The Welsh Wails' was the 38th (Welsh) Division's Concert Party. From
1917-19 it was run by Eric Blore, an English born actor who was later to find fame in Hollywood as a
character actor, specialising in quintessential English roles, such as butlers.
A ‘sap” is a trench extending from a main line, usually a front line.
