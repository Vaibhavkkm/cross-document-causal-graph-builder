Text  We are still out of it - very much to our disgust again  for after travelling miles on foot & getting well into the "zone"  of the present action we are noting indications that we are  not going to do any further work here.  It is a pity for our boys have been a long time now  without action they are all as keen as mustard & very anxious  to get with IT. This fooling around mucking about tactic  try our patience to the utmost, and as we have had the  boys up to "concert pitch" so long, we are very disappointed.  Many times now we have been posted - Last May we  were to have had a job - a raid on Machetich Wadi  two battalions & a squad of Lt. Horse - but at the last minute  that scheme was abandoned. Again we were sent out to  the front line to stop a projected Turkish Canal attack -  but Jacko didn't turn up. The Darfur & Senussi jobs  were given to the Pommies - so we missed those.  Next we came here - & our Div. has not had one raid  as we are always shifted just as our turn was coming off.  We missed the big stunt at Armentieres (Fleurbaix?) - because we  were wanted here, now we seem to have missed this  I can tell you we feel awfully disappointed as we're  all in absolute readiness to push off, but the order to  go forward hasn't come.  My men are all collectively & separately well trained  for bomb throwing, Lewis gun work &c. and they are in  tip top form. I don't know how we will keep them occupied  as things are getting monotonous - but we hope to go in yet.  No more news. Recd your letters early June.  Best of all good wishes for health, &c with much love from, Rollo .
