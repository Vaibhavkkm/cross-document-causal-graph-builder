Oct. 28th.
I finished up guard at 8
o'clock this morning having spent
most of the day in-doors and
the night on deck. At 4 a.m.
I went on the hospital door
for 4 hours. but as there was
about 12 transports on my side
and lovely Orion and his
train of stars overhead.
My first watch was from
four to eight in the afternoon
on the poop deck. My duty
was to keep men away from
the isolation areas which
contain 30 venereal patients
with three already discharged.
This seems terrible on one
ship only and gives an idea
of the prevailence of this
disease even in Sydney
where prostitution is prohibited.
91 outdoor patients attended the
hospital cheifly with influenza.
 
The sun hasc shone in
patches only to-day there has
also been showers of rain
The evening came on with
a pretty variety of dull daub
coloured clouds when there
appeared a bluish light in
the West which grew & grew
first to purple and on to
crimson which in turn gave
place to real gold effects
which reflected as yellow haze
all around us, and gave
the regular wavelets from
the ships side to the shore, some
400 yards, the remarkable
appearance of golden stairs
It was a glorious sunset,
and the remarkable part was
the short space of time from
in which it all happened,
about 15 minutes only.
I tried to sleep on the open
deck until 4 a.m. when I went on duty again, but
matters were very quiet and I
enjoyed the coming of dawn day.
Day commenced to break at
4.30 with a set of pretty
greys changing every moment,
but unlike the sunset of the previous
evening, its coming progressed
slowly and surely with changing
greys and wonderful soft shadows
Gradually the stars disappeared
until even those of the first
magitude had melted out.
The 22 22 well lighted transports at anchor
and up making a 
fine show during the dark
hours of the night now faded
into insignificance and left
the huge hulks standing out
against the skyline in such
irrigular fashion that they seemed
to spoil the transquil beauty
of the Sounds and the suns
 
dainty preliminaries to another
day's work. TheA powerful
lighthouse on a huge granite
boulder island at the
which marks the entrance is
struggling fitfully, almost
painfully to sustain its
poud proud brilliancy but
the surrounding sky grows
lighter and offer no background
or assistance and
it slowly sinks beyond 
recognition.
As the "two blb bells"
proclaim the hour of 5 o'clock.
the twilight gives as last
gives way seccums to the day, and  the
cold looking transports show
up their adornments and
graceful ease once again.
This business of guarding
hospital approaches seems a very
funny business indeed for a
fighting spirit to contend with. The New Zealand contingent
arrived in St Georges Sound
at noon to-day, accompanied
by some four warvessels.
There appeared to be 8 transports
while I believe their number
is about 8,000. men.
The whole ship seems to be
settling down in good style
at present. There is
much gambling going on, the
"Top of the House" being the most
popular pool game.
Poker & banker (on the quite)
still goes on and it is common
to hear of men winning &
losing from anything up to
£60.0.0.
Notice is now given that all
gambling must cease.
