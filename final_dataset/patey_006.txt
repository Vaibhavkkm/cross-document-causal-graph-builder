September. 10th 1914, We met the convoy with the  Australian expedition for New Britain,  yesterday an I expect to arrive  and occupy the place tomorrow.  I am to sending in the Destroyers   to have a look round the place   to night and to attack. the  wireless station which we could not  find last time. When we met  the convoy yesterday, we at last  got some of our missing mail  and I was very glad to get your   letter of July 9th written from  [[Darolish?]], but I fancy there must   be two of your letters missing  and we have one whole English  mail missing. I hope they will turn up sometime. I am afraid  this war must be upsetting you all  very much at home.
