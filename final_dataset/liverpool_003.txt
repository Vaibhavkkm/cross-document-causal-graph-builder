Dear General Birdwood, With regard to our many telegrams which have passed between us on the question of the use of a certain cypher, it is a curious thing that you were permitted to use it and its use was prohibited here so far back as last December. As soon as you told me that you were using it, I telegraphed to the Secretary of State for War to ask if we could also use it, because all correspondence with you has had to pass through me in another cypher which I alone had, and all routine work of the Defence Office so far as correspondence with you was concerned has had to pass through my hands, which I can tell you at a time like this, as you will well realize, was pretty "thick". With regard to another subject which I telegraphed to you about, I frankly do not understand the methods of censorship which takes place in Egypt. I get personal and secret messages from the Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of State for the Colonies enjoining me to the utmost secrecy, and yet code telegrams and even scarcely veiled open telegrams are allowed to pass the Censors both in Egypt and England. I get instructions to re-censor here, and that is all very well up to a certain point, but it naturally means that information which is considered most secret passes through a further number of hands; nor is this all, because it entails an enormous amount of work to the Censors here, (and we have none too many of them available) whereas the whole matter could much more expeditiously be dealt with at the office of origin. I think it well that you should know what both myself and my Government think of this question, because having corresponded 
with you only by cable you may have thought me somewhat fussy on the matter and one cannot put all that one thinks into telegrams. We are all very much pleased at the report that General Spens has forwarded with regard to the training which has taken place of the troops in New Zealand and which points to the fact that you and senior officers are pleased with what has been done in this respect in this Dominion.
Yours sincerely, Liverpool.
