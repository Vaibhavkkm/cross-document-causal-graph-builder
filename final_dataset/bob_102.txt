 My dear Mum, Am at present in my dug - out very busy and of course very worried we are not having too good a time Major Pulling wounded last night, the Colonel to-day besides several others previously Harry Murray in charge of the Battalion at present. The mosquitoes are nearly eating me alive waiting for certain things to happen so thought I would just drop you a line mails from Australia seem to go to the bottom regularly so of course we lose our home mail however it cannot be helped Am miles behind in my letter writing seem to get so little time these days am still running A Coy and expect my Captaincy through any day now will be quite a big bang will sound some class Capt R.J Henderson M.C. what do you think? Of course extra responsibility, worry and trouble still one will try & do ones 'bit' still with a certain amount of common sense and ability I hope. Had a letter from Hope Davies the other day poor little girl is very upset I have not written to her thinks I am annoyed with her or something silly like that however wrote her a note & said all sorts of nice things. Hana I fancy will be in the line last time I saw him everything was right Paris leave is open shall try and get 5 day off at first opportunity to visit that city £100 pounds has arrived in London & placed to my credit at the Bank NSW there so should be set for awhile. Many reports etc have just come in which I shall have to attend to right away. You may not believe it but much shell fire M. G. fire is falling all around still why worry used to it now Love to all, Bob.
