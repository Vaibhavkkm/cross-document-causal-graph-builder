My dear Mum, Have just returned from Scotland where I have spent a week and of course had a real good time the weather was not the best for seeing places to advantage still in this country one cannot afford to let the weather interfere with their plans. Have sent you a couple of views of the house & place where I stayed for a while It was very swank servants galore billiard table shooting fishing riding motoring tennis bridge etc etc so you see one had plenty to amuse them Then I put a couple of days in at the North British Hotel. Edinburgh had a look over the castle also the place where Mary Queen of Scots lived etc What a funny little town Edinburgh is I was rather disappointed with it you should see their beastly cable trams we have much 
better tanks at the front also quicker. Every body and every thing is very slow there in fact quite a dead city after London. There is one thing the Scotch people can do that is brew the finest whiskey I have ever tasted and believe me they can drink it to Sent out to the Bank for some more money which has come through I must really make this lot see me through but one cannot stay in this town without spending a lot of money. The leg is quite better now still having massage but shall clear out of hospital about the middle of this month expect to get a little leave then may stay in London or may go to Ireland it all depends have been lucky missing the winter in France expect mucking about etc it will be about the end of February before I get back to the battalion again Am having rather a rough time with the dentist at present suppose it will be rougher when the bill comes in. Have had no mail from Australia for quite a time but do not give up hope Cabled Xmas greetings to you all the other day shall cable again when leaving England. lots of love to all, Boby
