  Dear Flo  I have just received a letter from Bob dated  2/7/16 He is quite well and said that he was writing  home the same day before I left Egypt I had some letters  for him and one of the lads from the Batt was being sent to  the camp where Bob was so I gave him the letters to give  to Bob and in his note he mentioned that he received  them  good luck  Steve  PS Give My Best  Wishes to all  Friends  within the next week or so  Everything in the Garden is lovely  or at least I hope so now I must close  as news is scarce and I know you will  read Mother's and also Minnies Note  So with best Love  I remain  Your Loving  Brother Steve
