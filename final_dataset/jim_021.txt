My dear Mother,
You will see I am still at this
depōt, and my stay has been much
longer than I expected. 
I have not had any letters from home
since I last wrote -     14th July, the latest.
There should be more letters shortly.
The weather is still wet and stormy,
as one must expect at the time of
an equinox.
We have started the football season
already, and played a match against
the 1st. Training Battalion yesterday.
Two 5th Bn officers, pals of Les, were
playing against us.  They recognised
me, and spoke very kindly.  Three
or four other 5th Bn. chaps lamented
Les the loss of Les as "one of the
battalion's very best."
I hope you will not think it was
out of place for me to be playing
so soon, but you will understand that I felt so worried that I was
glad of a game to forget for a while.
Somehow I am always thinking of
you now, dear mother, and wondering
if you are pining, or bearing up
bravely against misfortune as behoves
a mother of such a fine chap as
Les was.
I daresay you got my cable
alright.  Possibly you had a notification
from Defence previously.
There is absolutely no news to
tell you from this side.  The news
from Palestine and the Balkans
is very encouraging, and the Western
front has quietened down.
I shall write again shortly.
Best love to all at home
                   Your affectionate son,
                                          Jim.
