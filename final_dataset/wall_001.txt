S.S. Geelong. W.A. June 7th  1915  Dearest Mum. Just a line to let you know how I got on coming across to here. I was a bit sick for a couple of days but it was nothing to talk about We had it pretty rough though it was blowing pretty hard from the time We left to the time we got here and we took 6 days to come. We have just sighted Rottnest Island when I am writing this and it is the first land we have got in sight of since we left so you may know some of them are very. pleased to see it as some of them have been bad all the way. I was wishing myself that I was home in bed the first night or so but I am all right now We get plenty to eat and good beds to sleep on and nothing much to do all day. We have not much idea where we are going to yet but you will see by the end where we think we are going to but I don't know whether it will be true or not but I hope so. I got paid allright but I will send it on to Eve for that trip. or if she doesn't go she can keep it. I can't put to much in the letter as there is a Censor on board. I don't think that we will get ashore at Fremantle at any 
we won't get on Leave. But we might parade the streets so I don't suppose I will get a chance of seeing Lily, but I will Try at anyrate. I hope Ev comes & sees you occasionally, but I don't suppose you will see her much as she won't go out much. I can't think of much to write about at present (Expurgated section) I must close now with lots of love to you all I am ,
Wall. Having a good Time
