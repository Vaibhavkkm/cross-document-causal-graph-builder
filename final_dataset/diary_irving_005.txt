At home. Again I have been tempted by ease and warmth and comfort and Leah and I awake at 8 but loaf and talk in bed till 10 in spite of having promised to go to work at 8. Wash and have breakfast with Leah which seems like sweetheart days and get 11 o’clock boat for New York. In shop at 11:30. Found stock report and find error in job which effects me for the rest of the day. Collections good. Boys glad to see me. Saw Willets who jollied me. Not in mood for it. Straightened up. Jordan calls. Go to bank and lunch at Zeitlin’s with Leah. Meet Eidenoff. Set type on return. Buy presents for boys. Consult Fried about seeing Wagner. Take books with me to work on tomorrow and rubbers for use in camp. Get home at 6:45. Glad to see me. Mama still continues practice of making pet dishes for me. Tell experiences. Go for haircut. Come back and talk and take a nap. Get 11:30 boat home. To bed at 12:45. Were it not for the presence of Leah, this would have been a cheerless day what with cold and my disappointment in Aaron. Leah thinks that I am not satisfied with her arrangements but convince her that I am before I say my prayers. Sleep well.
