  and an absolute God send out in that damned desert. The cheese was very welcome, we'd seen none for months, and as for the milo, chocolates, & other goodies - well they were "bonza" welcome.  I have given up smoking so passed the tobacco on - & that soon went & as tobac issues in the desert are infrequent & unsatisfactory I enclose a snap or two I took in Cairo - will send others in future until I get my lot sent home. We had all our cameras collected before we were embarked at Railhead - so I said "Good-bye" to mine. I have no more news now - but will write again in a few days' time - so I'll close with very much love, & the best of all good wishes to you all Your loving son Rollo Hope you are all as well as I am.
