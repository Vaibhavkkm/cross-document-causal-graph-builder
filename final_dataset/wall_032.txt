9th (Scottish) Officer Cadet Battalion, Gailes, Ayrshire. Monday, November 5th, 1916. Dear Mum, Well old Lady I am still up here although I can tell you I have been wishing I was away from it long ago. We passed our exam over a fortnight & we are still kept messing around this place. I passed top of my Company so I didn't do so badly & I didn't study hardly at all for it. By jove Scotland & England are expensive places to be stopping in. Look. that money Blanche owed you, well she doesn't owe it any more because I owe it to you & I hope to be able to pay for it as soon as I get back to France. & get squared up. I have paid about £16 for Clothes since I came up here. & I can tell you apart from that. I have spent a bit but I can assure you it has all been spent seeing places. 
in Scotland & England. I can tell you I don't feel like missing this chance of seeing the place whilst I am here even though it does cost me more pay than I draw as it is a chance in a lf life time & I don't suppose I shall even get it again. I shall name some of the places I have been to in Scotland Ayr. Troon. Irvine. Kilmarnock. Kilwinning. Dalry. Buith. Salcoats. Stevinston. Largs. Fairlie Ardrossan. Glasgow. Edinburgh. Paisley. Perth Port Glasgow. Aberdeen. Dundee. Arbroath. Montrose & lots of other too numerous to mention. & I can tell you it is worth spending the money to see the places so if you have got another wire asking you to send Blanche money you will know what it is for. Look mum if you are ever short of money just take what you want of mine & don't even bother about paying it back because I am young yet I shall be able to work for it. How it that block of hand getting along. 
I suppose it is still in the same place. Are the cars running down Ring street yet? I shall look up Bob as soon as I get down to London again & if I have any money to spare I will give it to him. I'll tell you what takes a good bit of my money. over here we get sent away on leave. & it costs us about 30/- a week for a room alone let alone meals & I can tell you everything is twice as dear as in Australia. Although I have been mixed up with chaps. who drink a lot & smoke. I don't do either yet. so none of my money goes that way. Have you seen Ev lately & is she looking alright yet & by the way is Dad getting about alright again. I hope he is. Look here is another thing I want you to do will you buy Ev & yourself a Christmas Present & you can buy yourself what you like a coat & skirt or anything up to £10 or more if you like but there is only one.  
thing I want you to do & that is to let  me know what you got yourself & Evie..  I shall not write & tell her you are getting her  anything but I want you to tell her it  is from me & with best love & wishes &   see that you don't forget it will you.  I would love to be able to send it myself.  but I am about as stiff now as ever I have  been & that is saying a lot & I can tell  you I have a good bit more stuff to  buy yet that I shall want as an officer  I should have just loved to have sent  to you & told you that I have my Commission  but I shall have it long before you   get this but don't address my letters as  Lieut until I tell you I have been  gazetted: So I must push off with  best love & wishes - for a bright & happy  Christmas to all at home. Dad & you & Jack  & Grandma & G.father & Aunts & Uncles & cousins   al & all from your xxxx  ever Loving Son xxxx  Wally.
