 2 am My dear Mum Have received quite of lot of letters from you also a parcel but have been exceedingly busy and no chance to write will try and answer all later when things settle down & become normal again if they do. We are doing fine work here rushed 
up at a critical time drive the Hun out of the village and are keeping. him at bay most thrilling experiences and hair breath escapes but so far am going strong no news of any relief yet all are very weary have been going strong for the past eleven days all leave is stopped and everyone going strong  of course our casualties are heavy but the enemys much heavier he seems to come at us in millions
of course has pushed through a lot but he is well in hand  now and must be suffering huge losses. Have had all sorts of fun here people had to clear out all in a hurry leaving everything fowls pigs wine beer champagne potatoes sugar china all househould gear sewing machines clothes everything you can imagine so we have been doing all right looting you may call it but as the Hun has blown the town to bits there is not one house standing now & it was practically complete four or five days ago it is just as well we hopped in for our cut. I have a lovely stove, bed mattress & bed clothes (which I never use to any extent sleep being scarce) plenty of tables chairs, dinner sets etc etc in my cellar which I think is moderately safe although I would not trust it too far however that is all in the game. All leave is cancelled for the time being which is rotten however hope to get away some day am about due for Blighty also put in for Paris before this business started. Cheer Oh for the present lots of love to all,  Bob
