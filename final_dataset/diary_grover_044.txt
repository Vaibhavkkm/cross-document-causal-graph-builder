April 26, 1918 – Ready for breakfast when a H.V. [high-velocity shell] got a direct hit on our house. Buried 6 men but no one hurt. Officers were all covered by dust and glass. Left here & went to funk holes2 in a field. I stopped a big piece with my tin hat. Very cold in the holes & nothing to eat but bully beef & tea. Left late in the p.m. for a new position. Much quieter. Good dinner & good sleep.
