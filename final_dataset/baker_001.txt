Rabaul Garrison 6/11/1914  Dear Jennie I am just thinking of you & wishing you in my heart Many Happy Returns.  This will be rather late in reaching you, (if it ever does); but you will know my thoughts were with you. Every thing is quiet here & althou a bit monotonous.  I am getting a good deal of fun out of it. One great thing, is I have been granted a permanent pass which allows me to go anywhere in the place.  So I may be able to purchase fresh food & stores for the officers mess, & if I want a ride or a drive, I only have to get a ferry or turnout, & there you are.
So you see I'm very comfortable & happy & having a really good time You have often read about the beauty of the South Sea Islands & I must say they have not been exagerated, no doubt you have often also read about the beautiful girls, but up to the present I haven't been able to discover where their beauty lies.  Some of the men are a very fine stamp indeed; but the women.  Uh! They give me horrible sudders down the spine. I had a lovely drive this morning.  I went over the hills through the "pass" to the other side of the Island. to try & get some fruit & vegetables.  I started at 6 o'clock & it was simply delightful in the cool but it was very hot coming back & my poor horse was very tired; but I let him jog along as he liked & he was allright. Perhaps you can follow me
if I try & paint a word picture First a straight level road with banana & brown nut plantations on the right with the hills behind them & little bits of native gardens & jungle on the left.  through which you could now & again get a glimpse of the glorious sparkling pacific.  Then a sharp turn to the right & a steady clime to the foot of the hills with thick scented tropical vegetation on either side. & palms often meeting overhead.  Then up a steep mountain road. which dissapeares into the face of the mountain.  through a tunnell. (which I beleive was made by Native prisoners) out into the glare again on the other side, then a long winding decent with native villages & their crude paintings & carvings scattered among the coconut. pines, Pawpaws, Bananas, rubber trees, etc. & finally down to the beach. where you watch the natives paddling about in their "dugouts" on the lagoon or wading
up to their waists spearing fish. A little further along you reach the mission station where I pulled up & the boys ran out & took charge of my horse & gave him a drink. & I had a rest & a chat with the missionary & then the return. So there you have some idea of the sort of country this is. I have no news for you so will close wishing you the Happiest Christmas possible in these terrible times. God bless & Guard you all Your loving brother Ernie
