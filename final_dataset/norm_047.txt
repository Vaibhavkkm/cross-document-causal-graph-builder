Text:  Dearest Mother & all at Home,   Just a line to  let you know that I am almost well  again & the Dr is sending me to   England next week for a couple of  months, so I expect to spend Xmas  there.  My temperature is normal  again & after a fortnight of liquid  foods, I am on light boiled eggs &  bread & butter? & custard & jellies.  I also get a small bottle of Stout  each night at 8pm to fix me up for  the night, so I'm not doing too bad.  I expect to be on Porridge & Chicken  soon, but those are luxuries for  Enteric patients.  The nurses here  are English & are not a patch on the  Australian Girls, they go about their  work too seriously & never smile
or joke like our girls.  They are very stict  with the Patients too.  They know nothing  about Australia & think it must be a   wild desolate place.  Yet they prefer  Australian patients to Tommies.  They are nearly all Tommies here &  there is 1 New Zealander, so I have some  one (colonial) who I can understand.  The  Tommies all speak the most peculiar  language & are very difficult to understand.  All my Mail is still at Anzac  so I've no news from home yet  Now Mother dear, don't worry about  me for I'm quite alright & will be doing   the "heavy" in England soon, so keep your  "pecker" up.  Give my love to everybody.  Mab, Rupert, Chas, George, Floss, Aunts &  Uncles & all enquirers & accept a  big whack from your loving son,  Norman.

I do not know what  unit I will be with  when I return from England  as a man is struck  off the strength if he is  away for 2 months  from his battery, so I'll  be looking for a job, eh
