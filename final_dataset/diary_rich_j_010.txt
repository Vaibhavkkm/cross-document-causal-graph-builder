Monday    Oct 12th In the afternoon we marched in full dress, with waterbottles & pouch down to Bondi beach, where at the cost of 5d most of the company went into the surf.  I could not see how I was going to get down to Manly by fair means so I just broke away after the swim walked up to Bellevue Hill caught the tram to the Five Ways where Joe Neilson is working for Williams, Chemist. I wraped up my belt haversack & bottle and carried it down to Hill Bros. where I gathered 1 doz silk stocking for W.Z. and with W.W. Hill took the 6 p.m. boat, I returned by the 10.15. I don't know what to make of this girl. I should, and believe, would, marry her, if I could see ahow I was going to provide a home in comfort. Marriage without a comfortable home and a settled position cannot be other than a failure.
