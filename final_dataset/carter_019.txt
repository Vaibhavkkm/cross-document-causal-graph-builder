May 11, 1915. My dear Father & Mother - I had a nasty jar yesterday when I heard that Teddy Townshend had been killed. He was about the best friend I had in the force. I find myself dreaming a lot at night now & all on the most calm & peaceful subjects. I feel most annoyed when waking to hear the rattle of musketry & roar of guns. I had a decent wash this afternoon
