2nd Stationary Hospital  
 Location: Mudros
 Mediteranean Expeditionary Force.  My Dear old Mother, I have temporarily settled down at the above address, so when writing you might send letters there. If I have moved on they will be forwarded. One is moved about  here, there, & everywhere, without notice so that  it is not safe to assume that we will remain in any spot for more than an hour or two. From what I have been able to learn since  coming here, I imagine that this hospital  will probably remain here for some time, unless they shift to Suvla Bay. They may be sent along there. Whether I will stay with them or not I don’t know. When I left Egypt I was supposed to be coming over here for either one of the Field Ambulances, or to act as Regimental Medical Officer to one of the Batallions, but at the last moment  was switched into this place. This  hospital consists of a lot of tents & very few beds - most of the patients simply lie side by side on the ground. I have ab seven tents, each one holding about 20 men, to look after. This particular type of Hospital is called a stationary hospital because it consists solely of tents, is staffed entirely by males, & is meant to be  moved about after the troops.  Xxxx Stanley Fosters Bataln is camped about  ¾ mile away from us, but I have not been able  to get over & see if he is still to be found yet.  Will try & get over there tomorrow. I don’t know where  Rex is  - Dr Cedric Dodds is over at Alexandria, wounded. I have met such a number of fellows that I know here - old Edinburgh men, some of them  particular friends of mine there. Sometimes  I could almost imagine that I was back in  Ramsay Lodge in Edinburgh again - there is such  a collection of fellows here who used to live there. Percy Wall is Adjutant in a camp about 200 yards  away - I walked in to him a few minutes  after I landed, & have been running across a succession of fellows I know ever since.
