 My dear Mum, Am spending a couple of days in Liverpool giving the good Hope a fly around. She is quite a nice kid and certainly enjoys being taken around and a good time. Yesterday we went down to Southport coming back here for dinner after which we went to the theatre. Of course Liverpool is funny more or less after
London the docks shipping etc are indeed wonderful. Called on Mrs. Davies also Miss Fabert (Aunty May) as per usual said all sorts of mad things to them told them I had all the pernicious habits drank swore went to races etc etc so do not know what they think still it is good fun. Have one more week yet before my holiday is over on this side returning to London 
Tomorrow have not yet decided whether I shall go to Scotland shall probably find London too fascinating. Have had no mail from Australia for some time now expect & hope there will be some for me when back with the Battn. Am wondering how they got on in this recent push suppose the  
usual thing many casualities however I hope not. Expect I am most fortunate really missing this show in any case there will be plenty more looks as if the war will go for another 3 years or so to-days beautiful thought. Of course am having a ripping time and making the best of my holiday it will be a case of going back to France for a rest I am afraid shall drop a line again soon lots of love to all,
Boby
