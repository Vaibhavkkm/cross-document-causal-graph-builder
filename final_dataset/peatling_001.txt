HIGH STREET, CARSHALTON. April 6, 1916.  Dear Sergant Ellsworth I was so completely taken by surprise this morning when you & the other three “boys" gave me that very charming letter & my wife the beautiful Brooch -pin, that I could not adequately thank you all for both. Please convey to the others the very heartfelt gratitude for the more than kind expressions towards myself. I feel that I’ve only done my job, & tried to carry out my duty “without fear or favour”;but it is none the less gratifying to know that you men all appreciated what little I have been able to do for you - although it seems so very paltry compared to what you have all done for the Empire & for me personally. I feel always personally indebted to any man who has been fighting. I’ve been through two campaigns & know something of the hardships you went through for us all but Im totally unable to concern the
Hell you four went through on the Peninsula. Every time my wife wears the brooch, (& that will be practically always) I shall think of you all - not only you four, but of the whole of the Australian Army of which we in the Motherland are so justly proud. Again  I thank you all for your kind remembrance & kinder appreciation of my small services, & with the very best of good wishes to each individually, & hoping through Gods mercy you may each one return home safely & in Good health, I remain  always your sincere wellwisher & friend A. J. Peatling.
