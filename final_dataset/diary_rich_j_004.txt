Oct 6 th Tuesday. We are this morning preparing for a march through the City. The fellows are keenly looking forward to it and are now bustling round in great expectation, it reminds me in a little higher level of the anxiety surrounding the preparation for a Sunday school picnix. The grand march past for which the public have been clamouring for weeks is now over, and from observations I mad believe it was a wonderful success. We filed out of Moore Park about the appointed time (11.45 a.m.) and from this point the whole route was thickly lined with people. The Army Medical Corps were last in the procession but nevertheless they came in for applause and complimentary criticism. We broke away from the main body at Darlinghurst at 1 o'clock after 1¼ hours a of hot but pleasant marching. Going though Macquarie St. where our Doctors are so well known we had a great reception particularly from the Hospital. Many of the people provided fruit for the troops the skins of which covered the Oxford St. It was very thoughtful indeed. I did not notice the artillery guns in the march, and this, from my own view point, is the most important weapon and the most inspiring looking object in this war business. At night a party of fellows went to the picture show in charge of an officer. They paid their own way The Colonal was very pleased at our showing to-day and complimented the company on parade on our return to camp but he did not grant any leave W.Z came out by tram we had tea at Coogee and arrived back in camp at 9.20. She is very fine and it was a shame for her to go right back to Manly alone.
No leave
