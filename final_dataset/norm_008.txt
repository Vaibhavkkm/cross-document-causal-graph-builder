Text:  Dearest Mother Just a line to let you know that we are here in the Sahara Desert right alongside the Pyramids & are getting into shape for the Glorious time to come. We arrived at Alexandria and disembarked & then we entrained for Cairo. Our horses & men are very fit and the journey through, alongside the Nile was simply beautiful. I only wish I could describe it to you. All the way down one could see the country on either side which was irrigated & very prosperous & the natives & their mud hut villages were very picturesque. The Arabs themselves are very filthy living people as well as disgusting beasts. They know no bounds to loading up their poor little donkeys & then climb up themselves & ride. Our fellows are always wanting to knock them down but Kitchener made a law forbidding white men hitting Arabs or other natives. Now about Cairo, Well Mother it is a wonderful City & the houses are simply mansions & exceed anything we have in Toorak or Melbourne, Of course the Arab quarters are different & are as vile & stinking places as one could imagine. Poverty is as conspicious as enormous wealth. At 2 am the other morning when we were marching out here, the poorer classes could be seen lying asleep on bridges & in gate ways & even on the pavements. We arrived at Cairo at 6 o'clock & detrained & went to the Barracks to water & feed our horses & at midnight we had to march out to our camping place (a distance of 10 Miles & leading our horses too) & at 3.15 am, we arrived in camp & proceeded to pitch camp & put down horse lines.
Well, it was very cold but our walk made us nice & warm & as soon as we picketed our horses, we all just lie down & got what sleep as we could get in 2½ hours & it was tremendously cold when we awoke. However, the sun gets up early in the Desert & soon gets to work & at 9 oclock, it is about 90 in the shade so this will tell you what kind of weather it is like. The Pyramids are right alongside our camp & are wonderful things, They are made of enormous blocks of stone & each one fitted in to each other & are about 400 feet high. The Electric Trams run right out to the camp & of course bring plenty of tourists to see the Pyramids. All the dirty work to done by Arabs & other natives at camp & the prinicipal method of conveyance is donkey carts & camels. These poor creatures are called on to do enough work to kill bullocks & the camels are loaded up with baggage of all sorts. We get Leave of Absence of a night & go into Cairo, & after having a tremendous feed, stroll about the City & see the sights. All the money is different & is in Piastres of which 97½ go to £1. There are all kind of people in Cairo, French, Turks, Arabs, English, Portugese, Italians, & Greeks, so there is plenty of variety. All troops are not in camp yet, as the boats have to wait some time to get through the Suez Canal. All the Desert on the north west of the Canal was flooded to prevent any Turks coming that way. We were not allowed to land at Port Said but what we could see of it, it was a stinking hole. I was very glad to get off the old boat & it was a treat to be on land again, I was that pleased that I ran like blazes when I got ashore for about 200 yards. The native police thrash the Arabs with canes & it is very funny to see them all going for their lives with a "John" after them & vendors selling oranges, Dates etc are knocked flying, and as they stoop to pick them up, the "John" gives them such a beauty over their rear as they pass 
We passed several Harems on our way down from Alexandria & saw the wealthy Egyptians with their numerous wives sitting on the banks of the River & of course we all gave them a great "Ahoy". But my word, Mum, the women were beautiful, their complexion exceeded anything I have ever seen, & dressed to kill. They were not dressed in Harem skirts, but ordinary stylish dresses. Other women were heavily veiled, & have a peculiar shaped stick on their noses. The French women in Cairo are remarkably beautiful & their dresses are wonderful in more senses than one, & how the devil they manage to get them to stick on I don't know the dress doesn't go over their shoulders at all Men of all classes only wear one sort of Hat, a little red turks cap called a Fez, Arabs wear any- thing that will go on, & the boys & girls up to 10 & 12 only a smile. We had a great "night out" the night before last, & finished up at 3.30 am riding donkeys It is very funny riding these poor little beasts & at the same time cruel, as an Arab runs behind all the way & thrashes his behind with a piece of packing case. The Roads are all like Commercial Road here, & have great trees all the way along & meet over head & the Motor Cars go like mad. I hope you got my other letters alright & I hope to get some soon (I have only got 1 from Victoria & that from Jack Tilton) I send my best love to every body who enquires after me & to Aunts & Uncles, Cousins & an extra ration to all at home & 2 extra rations for yourself from your loving son, Norman.
 I am in the best of health. 
All our washing to done for 1/6 per man per month by the Arabs. I have plenty of clothes & bed clothes / We take Egypt & march through the City on the 21st of this month so that means another Ribbon.


P.S I have plenty of money so don't worry (£6.12.0) & plenty of clean clothes. I hope you are all well. I hope you get the  money from the Barracks alright
