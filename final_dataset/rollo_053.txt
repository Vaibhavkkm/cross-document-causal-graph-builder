Text:  Several officers of ours have been so bad (enteric) that  they are being returned to Aussie - Stopp & Jack Gordon  have gone - Hemming also likely - whilst Weir is also  reported to be very bad. & may go too.  S.I. is now reported down with pleurisy - but anyhow -  he was having a huge holiday in Egypt. & if he'd  come up here like a man he'd have missed that.  I'm about due for a temp. Captaincy - but I'm  afraid my seniors - (over whom I've been moved) will  object to that. I won't go gray with disappointment  - but anyhow- 3 stars look better than 2 - so I  won't say 'no' if I'm asked to take it on.  Major Shaw is now temp. Lieut Col. and I am  glad, for he & Giles are the only two who have  "stuck it" from the very jump.  I notice a lot of 'cold footers' have been called  up to train recruits. It's time they were booted in,  as they're recd promotion in our absence, - but we'll  give them their deserts soon. It's despicable that  men holding the King's commission should act so.  News just through that Mackensen is leading  the Hun armies at Belgrade. Gen. Walker was in  a M. gun position in my line yesterday - & copped it  in the arm. Slight wound -. fainted - (fairly old) - but  I don't suppose I'll get a V.C. for helping him.  I'm tip-top. Love tc. Rollo
