Rabaul. Simsons Haven.  Sunday. September. 13th, 1914 We have now taken, Rabaul  and Herbertshore without opposition  but a party of Naval Reserves I landed  to attack the wireless station had  some severe fighting in the Bush  with a large number of Native Police   under German Officers. We lost two  Officers and four men killed, and   one Officer and three men wounded  they were fighting all day and I had  to re-inforce them but they did splendidly  and eventually captured the place at   midnight. We have taken a lot of  Prisoners including twelve German  Officers & [[Nm?]] Command Officers, one of   them is the Commandant. The   Brigadier General is now in charge in   Shore, and as soon as I have seen things  properly settled., I am leaving with Australia' 'Melbourne', & 'Sydney'  for Sydney to escort the Australian  expeditionary force across the Indian  Ocean as far as Aden, and  then return to Australia. I am  very busy so must end.  With best love to you all  I remain  Your very affectionate brother  George E. Patey  Many thanks for your   letter of the 9th of July which  has just turned up.
