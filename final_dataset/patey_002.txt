We have had no mail  from England since leaving Sydney  a month ago. Hope you are all well H.M.A.S. AUSTRALIA.  At Sea.  Saturday. August 29th, 1914,     My dear Helen  I hope to have a chance   of posting a letter in about a  weeks time so am corresponding  now as I never know when I  shall have any time to myself  I posted a letter to Charles from   Suva Fiji on Wednesday.  We are now on our way to Samoa  with an expedition force to  take this place. I expect to  arrive there tomorrow morning  I don't know whether there will  be any resistance or not. I know  
it is not a properly fortified place   but there are stories of mines  having been laid and guns  landed so I must be ready for  anything. I shall not post  this until it is all over so it  my mentioning these things  does not matter now. If all goes well  I shall leave the troops at Samoa  and return probably to the Australian  coast. We had bad weather all  yesterday and it is blowing fresh to  day which has rather delayed us  We only stayed at Suva long enough  to coal. It seemed to be a very  pretty place but of course I had no   time to look around, and it was    raining hard all the time we were  there. We get rather conflicting news  of the war in France but we   seem to be getting slowly driven back  by superior numbers at present.  and there seems to be little or no  fighting in the North Sea.
