Text:  We are anxious to take the initiative - & hence our delight in being told we're to go to Rail-head - a place in rear of Habeita. 49 & 50 are under orders - but so far we can only conjecture what'll follow. If we give them a hiding now, it will free Egypt from the Turkish menace - & set the A.I.F. free for France - for the Katia affair is the cause of us still being here instead of on the Mediterranean. If any scrapping occurs our batts. will be in it but I understand we are not going to be wasted on a desert campaign - other troops will relieve us - and the L.H. will be just the ones required for such work. We're told we may be out only a few days, & then off to France - but of course rumours are flying & lying In a few days I will be able to write definitely. Townsend at Kut put up a good go but had no luck re supplies - & now Jacko may try an Egyptian invasion - but he'll find us ready. Our 'circus' is getting ready - so I must close - my next letter may be from Gebel or Jerusalem - but will have a bit of scrapping first. Very much love & best of good wishes Rollo   Pt Said  Kansara  El Arish  Katia Hassana  Jif Jaffa  Ismalia  Habeita  Railhd  Marghsara  Serapeum  Suez  Sin.
