At Camp - Sleep at Home
(first page missing) fore order to fall in outside. Inspected. Off for trains, time 5:00. Bayonet class, singing, and saying detail, for show, on train. Cold. Car to smokers. In Penn Station after uninteresting trip at 8:00. March through 34th Street to 71st Regiment Armory. A new thrill for me. Heads up with an air of superiority. Leave arms in beautiful gun cases. Go home to Mama. She is surprised that I am so early. As usual a fight for priority in kisses. A great big supper till I am ashamed to eat more. Home on 11:00 boat. Staten Island a welcome sight to me. To bed at 12:00. New big featherbed under which I am too warm. Chest so congested I cannot breathe. Nose clogged. I have to rub chest and fight for air. Get of out bed and gyrate arms to limber up a bit. Open windows and go back to bed much relieved. A pleasant day, a feeling of freedom. Much worried about having to do guard duty over guns. Happily dissipated on arrival at Armory.
