Text:  Don't be surprised or anxious if my letters are more irregular then usual - as transport is limited & if we go inland - mails will be few & far between - & also will be held up. I will write frequently, & chance the mails being blocked. Best of all good wishes - health - good luck & very much love to you all - Much love Rollo
