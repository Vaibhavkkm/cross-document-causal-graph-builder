Dear Sir William Birdwood, 1.    I want first of all to convey to you my best congratulations on the Honour which His Majesty the King has conferred upon you on the occasion of his Birthday. 2.    Knowing the interest which you take in everything concerning New Zealanders, and also for obvious reasons which I shall give, I want to tell you that there is considerable annoyance here over the raising of the additional Fourth Brigade, a step which my Ministers never approved of, although under certain stipulations they allowed it to be formed, the most stringent stipulation being that this Government would not provide any reinforcements for the Brigade, and that the reinforcements for the New Zealand Division must not be depleted.   The position now is, that if any reinforcements are required for the New Zealand Division over and above what are being now sent, the Brigade has got to be disbanded, the reason being that the New Zealand Government are determined to carry out the obligations which they imposed upon themselves and which represent the maximum which they consider they can do : they will run no risk of failing. I tell you all this because there is a strong feeling amongst all classes in New Zealand that Godley is responsible for having let this Government in to acquiescing in the raising of the Fourth Brigade, and although this has been repudiated nothing that anyone can say will convince the people that such is not the case.    Godley is more unpopular now
than he has ever been before, and the question may possibly be raised in Parliament to get the New Zealand Troops put under your Command, as both soldiers and civilians alike are most anxious that this shall be done.   It is for this reason that I thought it right to tell you quite privately about the matter : the question may indeed crop up before this letter reaches you. With every good wish,
Believe me, Yours sincerely, Liverpool
