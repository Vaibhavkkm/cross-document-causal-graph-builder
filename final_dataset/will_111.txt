A" COMPANY, No. 4 Officer Cadet Battn., NEW COLLEGE OXFORD.  17/11/1917  Dear General Birdwood, I have just noticed in the "Times" that you have received, at last, well-earned promotion, and I hasten to congratulate you. At the same time the paragraph was misleading to me. It stated "aide-de- camp to the King." While I do not grudge His Majesty
the benefit of your services, from the bottom of my heart I hope that the troops from my beloved native land have not lost you as their General. We have been under your command too long - through cloudless days of victory and amid the sombre trials of desperation - not to have appreciated you to the full, and were we to learn that your elevation necessitated transferrence to other spheres there would be, more especially among those of us who survived the Gallipoli Campaign and who were with you through those
trying months a deep-rooted feeling of whole-souled regret. On the other hand there are rumours (rumour flies more speedily in the rank and file of military circles than in any other theatre I know) that you are going to take charge of operations at Mesopotamia or some other front. If such is the case I would like to be under your command. Although I am at present undergoing a course here, with a view to promotion, I would cheerfully and
willingly sacrifice these prospects to serve under you in any capacity.  Faithfully Yours, J.W. Kerr
