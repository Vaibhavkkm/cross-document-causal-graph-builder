March 25th. Sunday. Morning Parade:-- 9.30 to 10.45. Church Parade. Leave to visit Amiens from 11. O'clock. I have heard that the only building left standing at Bapaume was the old Town Hall. Our troops and a Comfort Fund people went into it and five days after the Germans left it they blew it up with a contact mine. About 40 persons being injured. This goes to show clearly that the German can never be trusted at any time. So if biscuits are found for instance rest assured they are poisoned. If anything is found at all just ask yourself the question as to why he left them behind.
