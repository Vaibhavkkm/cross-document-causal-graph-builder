Text:  Dear Father & Mother,-  I recd your cable yesterday telling me that  George had just left A, & was due to arrive in Eng.  about the end of March. I am afraid my chance of  meeting him is very remote, as by that time we  will be in front again - and perhaps pushing out  well beyond Bapaume &there'll be no chance of  Spec. Leave. I've already sent in an application  to H.Q. &if I get it now I'll be coming back before  G. can be anywhere near England so my luck  is out this time.  Today I recd your letter of 8.1.17 - the only  mail since 20.12.16 - &the first news from [[Wrimps]]   & Mum since 13.12.16. I think some mail has  gone astray - anyhow what is wrong with George.  I know he got a knock on the jaw (which broke)  while boxing - & then in a subsequent letter you mentioned the injury to his eye would probably  prevent him sailing on the Omrah - (Jan 5th) &  from then to end of Feb. is a rather long time to  be delayed on a/c of his eye. What was wrong?  As he has sailed I suppose its O.K. again but  in future let me know right away as soon as  anything goes wrong?  Fritz is slowly falling back, &our boys are
helping him along a little quicker than he likes as  we have about 7 miles of front to look after.  If Fritz stands at Bapaume you will probably  find our Divy helping him out of it. Bapaume  would be a nice stunt - guess there'll be something  down there during the next fortnight, & I dont  think we'll be far away.  45 days we worried him &then we were relieved.  It was the 49th night that he cleared out, so  you can imagine how annoying it was to be on  our way back here while Fritz was [["sloping"]].  Our Div. worried him a lot in the [[Gondecourt]]  area.  I was glad to hear of your Xmas at Unley -  hope I'll be with you at the next one.  Lance Cpl Scott has managed to be sent back to A.  Fritz tried to make a sieve of him - but I hope  he is not incapacitated - as he was a splendid  man - gave up a farm near Gladstone - but I  think his people live in N. Unley.  Don't worry about Fritz & his TANKS - we are  not afraid of anything pertaining to him, &so far  we have circumvented &even bettered his best  tricks - &now he's feeling the stress extremely.  It's over a year since the 50th was formed, &are  nearly all are still going strong in various ways
[[Loutit]] is Major now - Fowler, Moule, Wilton,  Seager, Smith - (Jacob (Lt. Col & O.C H) &myself  are all going strong - Herbert & Hancock are  with the [[Trng.]] Battn. &[[Dinden]] is still a memory  to us of a gallant gentleman. I intend to  ride across to [[Warloi]] on Sunday to see his  grave. The only French friends I have made  are looking after it.  Perhaps [[Wumps}} would like to write to one  of them - (age 18) - if she writes simple &clear  English &mentions she is my sister - I am  sure she will get an amusing reply  Mlle Melitia Carney  Warloy Baillon  Somme  France  News is uncertain - I can only say definitely  that we are winning now  I'll close with my very very best of all  good wishes to you all for prosperity, success,  good health, &all sorts of good luck - with  much love to yourselves from  Yr loving son  Rollo.     Letter to Harry same date
