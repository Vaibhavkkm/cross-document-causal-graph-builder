My Dear old Mother, I was very glad to get your wire on the boat in Sydney &  hear that all was well with everyone. I expect the little people are getting down to the new order of things quite well. They are very sensible little customers. I spent the afternoon at Bondi, but did not see the girls as they were out. They came down to the ships on Saturday & saw them there for a few moments. Mr Robinson & his daughters came down, likewise Aunt Emma. Have had a lovely trip so far round to Melbourne. Hope it will keep so. I see that amongst the doctor's joining here is a Dr O'Hara who was at Edinburgh with me - haven't seen him since I was there. The big Irishman is my cabin - mate - a real good sort too he is. Have only time for a line as I [* must rush off up town. Saw the Vintner family yesterday but have not seen Eva - will not have time. Ever so much love. from your loving son.*]
