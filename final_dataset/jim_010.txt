Dearest Mother & Father, I am afraid this is going to be rather a rough old letter. I have come home early and gone to bed, but now that I am in bed I feel like writing a letter.
Things are much as usual in London. I am still doing my job on Hdqrs week in week out without much variation. The weekend before last I went down to Bournemouth for a couple of days, the Monday (this Monday) being a public holiday. 
We were fortunate enough to strike two successive fine days and had a good time.  We went in swimming in the Eng. Channel.  The water was very cold but the swim was very enjoyable nevertheless.  Last Sunday I went to an exhibition of Australian War Pictures at the Grafton Galleries.  They are very fine indeed, and will eventually be seen in Australia I suppose.
The Germans have made a further big attack, and tonight's paper reports them across the River Aisne.  They have achieved a good initial success and it remains to be seen if they will be able to follow it up. I had a letter from Leo a few days ago. He is well and going strong.  He has no word of going back to France as yet. I think it is better to send my papers direct. It will save the doc. a good deal of trouble in bringing them up from Westcliff.  He is a very busy man these times at the Admiralty, and I seldom see him at all.  The air raid last Sunday night week on London was the first I have missed. There were over 200 casualties. The light is failing so I must bid you goodnight. 
Fondest love from Jim.
