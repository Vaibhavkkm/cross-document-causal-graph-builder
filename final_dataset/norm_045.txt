Lemnos  24th September 1915   Dearest Mother & all at home,  Just a few lines to  let you know that I am enjoying a fortnights  holiday here at present, & I can tell you I am  beginning to feel something like my old self  again, thank goodness, for I was feeling that  run down, that I had to decline promotion to the  rank of Sergeant Major in the Ammunition Column, as  I felt so crook, but I am feeling grand again now  & improving every day. We had a little difficulty in  getting here & had to wade across portion of the bay in  order to reach the rest camp, so what with being  24 hours without anything to eat, and having our kits to  carry & a good way to walk, we were pretty well good  for nothing when we got here, but we have been treated  splendidly ever since, & good" tucker", & no drill, except  an hours marching in the morning, then we are off   for the rest of the day, & go off to the different  Greek Villages & visit the warships, etc etc & as the  weather is fine, you can see we are thoroughly  enjoying ourselves. The Greeks are peculiar people  being content to live a quiet life, in houses built of unshaped stones or mud bricks. They  are a clean healthy living people & very quiet,  but appear to have no ambition to improve  their mode of living, or get on in any way.  The women folk are always spinning cotton &  such like, dat  as their domestic duties don't take  1/2 an hour a day & the men seem to have an  easy life.  There are all kinds of troops here, French,  British, Senegalese, Zouaves, Australians & other kinds, as  well as a lot of Turkish prisoners, who are a very  contented looking lot, & are well cared for.  There are any amount of British & French  warships of all sorts here, & when they to get  through the narrows, something is sure to happen.  The new monitors are torpedo proof & have  14 inch guns, so we are expecting great things  of them.  You will be surprised to learn that I  have broken the pledge & have drunk a  half bottle of stout one night. I was feeling   pretty crook & one of my friends in the   Medical unit came & doctored me up & made   me drink it, but oh, what a horrid taste  it has. Never again. Each man gets 
Let Constable Watson know that   I'm doing alright.
Norman.
