The Official War Historian of the Commonwealth  Government (Dr. C. E. W. Bean), after his study of the  collection of private war records preserved in the Australian  War Memorial Library, wrote:-  "The private diaries in this collection furnish some of its most  valuable historical records, but, like all private memoirs which were  not compiled with any historical purpose, they should not be  regarded as first-hand evidence except where it is certain that they  are so. The diarist is almost always sincere in his desire to record  accurately, but he is subject to no obligation or inducement to  indicate whether he is recording his own observations or incidents  told him by friends or heard at third or fourth hand at the mess-table.  Thus, in some of the diaries in this collection, scenes described with  vivid detail, and without any warning that they are told at second  or third hand, have been found to be completely inaccurate in  important details. A certain number also have been written up  or revised long after the events, though doubtless usually from notes  made at the time. In most cases the student must rely on his  experience and on internal evidence to guide him in judging what is  and what is not likely to be historically accurate."
