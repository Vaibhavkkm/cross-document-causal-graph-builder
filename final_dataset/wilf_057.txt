Syrian Desert  18.8.1916  My dear mother I am commencing a letter in the dusk & fear that I will be unable to finish it as we have no lamps here  & it is practically dark already. I  received two letters from you yesterday  brought out from our base camp by  an officer who joined us. Surely the  most romantic mail - received while  sitting under a palm tree with sand  everywhere except in the oasis. It was  very welcome too as we were longing for  news. I must try & give you some  definite account of our trip & will  commence from the beginning  Next morning  We left Bally Bunion on 14 4.8.16 & travelled through Hill 70 to Duedah - I must send a map later with these places on, but Bally Bunion  is about 15 miles north of Ismailia & Duedah about 20 miles north again. Serapeum where we  were previously is 12 miles South of Ismailia  We received only about an hours notice & so  had to hustle, could carry, waterproof sheet &  blanket on horse, a days horse feed, waterbottle.  & haversack on ourselves with day's rations  so we were fairly well laden. We arrived at
Hill 70 about midday very hot & very thirsty  & occupied some sheds there & had lunch  moving on again at 5:30pm to Duedah  where we picketed the horses & dossed down  in the open. We rose about 3am & pushed  on. We went to Hod Bir-el-Nuss about 8 miles  east of Duedah & there watered our  horses and rested. You will understand that   all through the country here are these  scattered palm groves & wells, water can   almost always be obtained among the  palm trees by digging a few feet  'Bir' means well & "Hod" a depression  almost always with a palm tree grove in it.  We depend on these for obtaining water for  the horses on our way through the desert  & so do the Turks. We had orders to   attack the Turks at Bir el Amna but  found that they had departed when   we advanced. Our news the previous  night was that the Turks had made  a big attack on Romani to the North   of us & were repulsed & the New Zealanders  on our left had attacked them & driven  them back also taking many prisoners.  We then proceeded due East & it was  scorching fearfully hot & when we  neared Bir el Hamisah our advance   guard came up with the enemy &  shots were fired. Orders were 
immediately given to attack from the  front & sides & soon the fighting became  general. I was in the rear with the  Colonel & after a while news came of  a wounded man on the left but on going  round found that he was bandaged  up & could hardly be reached on account  of fire so gave orders for him to be  brought round when conditions were  more favorable as his wound was  not serious. Then word came of wounded  on right & went there, found one of  our chaps shot through liver & in  great pain, bandaged him up &  gave Morphia which relieved him but  his condition was hopeless &  he died later. Then found several  wounded Turks & we made a kind  of shelter for them from old oil  sheets left by Turks & some sticks  & bandaged them up, gave one or   two Morphia & as much water as  we could spare for we had only  very little & they soon drank the  most of it & wanted more. Then  We also found several dead Turks  here & a lot of rifles & equipment  left behind by them then went  further on & attended to one of our  own wounded. The fight was  moving on & prisoners were coming  in quickly & in large numbers  Our artillery now came up & opened  fire but shortly afterwards the Turks  commenced to reply with high  explosives from a 6 inch howitzer  & the Brigadier decided to withdraw  for the day. Just at this time our  men had captured or destroyed  8 machine guns but were being  heavily shelled although they were   fortunate enough to escape damage from shells  We then returned for the night with our  prisoners 425 in all to a hod near  by & glad we were to get there as the  fight commenced at midday &  continued until 5 o'clock in this burning  tropical heat. Men & horses were very  tired & suffered greatly from thirst  I had to change horses as mine  was completely exhausted. We  watered horses in the hod & made some  tea & then saddled up again & went  about 2 miles further back to camp  in the desert & we just flopped down  in the sand & fell fast asleep. Next  day our regiment were sent back a  little to water but we found none &  had to return about six miles to the 
hod we had watered in the previous  night to obtain any. It was about  ten o'clock when we arrived there &  the sun for the previous 3 hours had  seemed like a furnace. We then made  tea from the brackish well water  (small quantities of fresh had been  sent out by camel convoy but we  wanted to reserve this for our water bottles.  That afternoon we set out again  eastward & the character of the desert  changed rather - it had previously  been fairly level but it now became   more hilly with numerous sand dunes  everywhere. As we ascended we could   see Katia to a few miles to our North  & the distant trees in the vicinity of the  canal away to the west. We  camped that night at a hod called  Sagia in the midst of the dunes  & a it was a very nice one too. All of the  hods have much the same characters  - a large steep hill of stand sand on   one side generally the west & then in  the depression a number of palm  trees leading on to an open plain of  sand beyond. We spent the night  here & rose as usual at about 2.30a.m.  watered & fed horses & pushed on. 
We had some difficulty in finding  the next hod & spent two hours  sitting on the burning sand at midday  trying to find shade under our horses until it was found & then we took refuge there & fed & watered again No sign of Turks all this time except footprints generally bare. Next morning up again at 2.30. & we trekked on passing on our way some very interesting old ruins with consisting of old pillars of stone brokin off at the base & made of cement & one portion more intact than the rest which had been occupied by  Bedouins. What it represented I have no idea but it was very  interesting to light on it thus. On  this day one of the other three regiments in the Brigade were advance guard  & came up with the Turks & had  a fairly sharp engagement. We were in support & were fairly heavily shelled during the day. We relieved  the leading regiment that afternoon  but it was mainly a case of sniping  & no one was hit. That night  the Turks slipped away again & next morning at 2.30 a.m we  
were up again & on their trail. We  did not see them until the next day  when the leading regiment bumped   up against them again & had  hard fighting all day & our own regiment  went up bit by bit to support  them. Our casualties were the  heaviest that day past that we  experienced as some of the fighting  was severe. W The Turks had  a very strong position on the top  of a commanding hill which  they had entrenched but they  must have lost very heavily.  I was with our artillery observer  once & through the glasses could  see the Turks returning up a hill  & our shrapnel bursting amongst  them as they went & following them  up under the directions of this  officer. At nightfall the other regiments  went back to the hod at the rear &  we remained to hold our position & next  morning reconnoitered the redoubt  again & found it still strongly  held. We were relieved that night  & went back to the hod at the rear  with the promise of a days spell next  day but instead rose as usual at  3 a.m. & went to the front where it had 
been found that the Turks had evacuated  the redoubt in the night & we  pressed on in pursuit. We went as  far almost as far as Hod  Salmana  & discovered the enemies rearguard  again. We made a demonstration &  were successful in drawing an  unpleasantly well directed shell fire  which was apparently our purpose  but fortunately no one was hit. Our  guns replied & bodies of the enemy  mounted on camels could be seen  retiring in the distance over the hills on  the horizon. Our object had apparently  been accomplished now as there is  practically no water beyond this part  before the Turkish base at El Maza  between here & El Arish & about 20  miles away & once the Turks were  driven over this it would apparently  be difficult for them to pass it again.  The last Turkish position was  admirably chosen as I said before & we  found behind it an abundant wate  supply in several good oases & they  b seemed to have been fairly comfortable  for they had brought goats & sheep  with them & cases of wine were  found as they are a not so destitute  as were are led to believe. We have 
now settled down here for a while just to watch & wait but I don't  think there is much chance of  their returning. We are glad to rest  for awhile as men & horses were  almost exhausted after such a  hard time rising at 3 a.m. after  only 3 - 5 hours sleep & spending  all day in the blazing Eastern sun  without shelter. We are under cover  of the palms here but sleep on the  high ground at night - waterproof  sheet underneath, blanket on top  & haversack for pillow so we are  quite campaigners. We obtain our  provisions & water by camel convoy  & feed fairly well. I am in good  condition & eat well. My letters  may be a little irregular as there  is no postal service yet, but I  am seizing an opportunity to send  this back as before, Goodbye for  present & best love - I do  hope Sandra is quite well by this  & you yourself in good health  with a hug  from  Wilf.
