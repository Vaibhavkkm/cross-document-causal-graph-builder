Tuesday       Sept. 29th. Physical drill with much  hated Bulmer in charge at 6.30 After breakfast all hands were very busy shifting tents a very interesting event under military supervision The whole camp was shifted forward giving everybody new and welcome ground. Bulled beef in the form of sea pie for dinner we have had no fresh meat in 4 days. The horses were taken for a swim to Coogee this afternoon. about 40 of the follows went in the surf. it was a great afternoon. The horses were most treactious, I just missed being kicked on the head twice by apparently tame horses. General leave until 10p m but I am remaining in camp.  to-night very tired.
