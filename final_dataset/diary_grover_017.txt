March 28, 1918 – Cold and windy. Breakfast, 11 a.m. No orders to move. Nothing doing all day and very glad. Personnel of Ambulance Corps: Lt. Co. Bird, C.O, Capt. Svenssoon, R.A.M.C., Capt. Turner, R.A.M.C., Lt. Lampkim [spelling suspect]. Very nice people. Capt. Austin, U.S.A., Philadelphia formerly attached, having lost his corps, returned yesterday, p.m. He’s awaiting orders. Very nice chap but “fed up”.
