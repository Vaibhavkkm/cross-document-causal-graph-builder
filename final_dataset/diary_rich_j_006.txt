Thursday.   Oct. 8th. I was very tired at drill this morning, this waking up at 5.30 and sleeping for a few hours on the hard ground does by no means suit me. I feel so very stiff and weak my weight I don't know, but judging by my activity and strength I have fallen away a hell of a lot since this camp life began. The 220 fellows are putting in 1d . a day to supply extra rations The camp grub is very poor very much so when you think that we are in the midst of plenty. One would think it time enough to live hard when it is absolutely necessary only. Harris, dentist, gold crowned one of my back teeth to day; £1-3-6. Left camp at 2 p m returned at 8 p.m.
