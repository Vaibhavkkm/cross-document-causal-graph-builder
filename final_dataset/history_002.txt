World War I
The 1914 election and the declaration of war
The 1914 election was announced on 26 June 1914—a double dissolution election to be held on
5 September 1914. Parliament was prorogued on 27 June, the day before the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand and dissolved on 30 July. Both parties had already formally launched their election campaigns before war broke out—Labor on 6 July and the Liberals on 15 July.
The election campaign focussed on domestic issues with neither Prime Minister Joseph Cook nor Opposition Leader Andrew Fisher mentioning the events in Europe until the end of July. Both leaders campaigned on much the same issues they had campaigned on at the 1913 election. Cook wanted to reform the Constitution to give the Commonwealth power over monopolies, introduce a uniform companies Act and set up wage fixing tribunals. He also said he wanted to introduce a new voting system—proportional representation in the Senate
and preferential voting for the House of Representatives.80 Fisher also wanted to reform the Constitution to give
the Commonwealth greater power. He promised marketing agencies for primary producers, an inquiry into the
prevention of diseases such as tuberculosis and help for orphans.81
On 30 July 1914, the Governor-General Munro Ferguson received the first official telegram from London warning
that war was imminent. As historian Douglas Newton notes, the Governor-General of Australia at this time
‘served in practice not only as commander-in-chief of the military forces, but also as a kind of Australian foreign
minister’, and all Imperial communications were sent through the vice-regal channel.
82 The Governor-General
passed a copy of the telegram to Senator Edward Millen, the Minister of Defence, who was in Sydney for a
political rally in Mosman. The following evening the Governor-General telegrammed the Prime Minister in
Ballarat: ‘Would it not be well, in view of latest news from Europe, that ministers should meet in order that
Imperial Government may know what support to expect from Australia?’83 This was an unusual step as it is not
up to a governor-general to suggest that Cabinet meet. Ferguson followed up with a letter to the Prime Minister,
explaining that he had suggested a Cabinet meeting because of the need for the Cook Government to ‘decide its
line of action’
, pointing out that Canada had already made its decision to commit to war.
84 Cook agreed and as
many cabinet ministers as could headed for Melbourne even though they were out and about campaigning. Only
five of the ten ministers made it to the emergency Cabinet meeting called for Monday 3 August.
The so-called ‘Warning Telegram’ was listed in Australia’s ‘General Scheme of Defence’ (1913) as the first of
seven possible telegrams that Britain would forward to Australia in the event that war was imminent. Each
telegram required certain actions to be taken, the first being to ‘Adopt Precautionary Stage against (Power(s)’. In
reality, the ‘Warning Telegram’ received by the Governor-General did not specify the ‘Power’ (or country) to
which the precautionary stage applied. Furthermore, the Governor-General’s official secretary had difficulty in
deciphering the message and transcribed the word ‘adopt’ as ‘adoption (adopt?)’, thereby making the nature of
the message unclear as to whether it was a request for information about the adoption of the precautionary
stage or a directive to adopt it. According to Newton’s close reading of events, ‘there followed some confusion …
in Cook’s circle that lasted until Saturday’, exacerbated by the fact that the Prime Minister was campaigning in
rural Victoria and his staff, based with him in Ballarat, were also unable to decipher the message because they
did not have the key to the cipher with them.
85
That night both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition responded in similar terms. The Prime
Minister told a meeting at Horsham in Victoria: ‘… whatever happens Australia is a part of the Empire right to
the full. Remember that when the Empire is at war so is Australia at war’
.
86 The Opposition Leader at Colac in
Victoria said: ‘Should the worst happen, after everything has been done that honour will permit, Australians will
stand beside [the mother country] to help and defend her to our last man and our last shilling.’87


A few days later, on Monday 3 August, Cabinet agreed to offer the British
Government two things: to put the newly-acquired Australian fleet of
seven ships under control of the British Admiralty, and to send an
expeditionary force of 20,000 troops overseas to wherever it was
required. Furthermore, it offered to bear all associated costs. The cable
was sent to London at 6.00 pm that evening, even before Britain had
decided its own response to the events in Europe and some 40 hours
before it actually declared war.88 Newton says about the cable that ‘In a
sense, it was the birth certificate of Anzac.’89 The Prime Minister
reiterated Australia’s support for Britain saying: ‘If the Armageddon is to
come you and I shall be in it.’90 According to the Australian War
Memorial:

The outbreak of war was greeted in Australia, as in many other places,
with great public enthusiasm. In response to the overwhelming
number of volunteers, the authorities set exacting physical standards
for recruits.91



Labor expressed no opposition to the Government’s action, having as far back as 1910 accepted that while there
were advantages in being a part of the British Empire, one of the accepted disadvantages, as stated by Defence
Minister George Pearce, was that Australia:
… may at any time be involved in a war in the causing of which we had no voice, and in which we have no desire to
take part. But, nevertheless, by reason of the fact that we are part of the Empire, we may be called upon, willy nilly,
to bear the consequences of our Imperial connexion.92
Furthermore, on the evening of Sunday 2 August, both Fisher and Billy Hughes, separately, issued statements
indicating that at such a time the interests of the nation were above party politics. They were responding to
Liberal suggestions that Labor was ‘dragging its feet’ on defence and that its policy would adversely affect
Australia.93
It needs to be remembered that this international crisis occurred right in the middle of campaigning for
Australia’s first double dissolution election following a parliament in which the Government had a majority of
just one seat in the lower house and the Opposition had control of the upper house. It was bound to be a hard-
fought political campaign. Labor’s stance could be seen as a way of neutralising defence and Home Rule for
Ireland as issues of difference between the parties.94 The issue of Home Rule had recently re-emerged. There
were large public meetings supporting Home Rule in May and June 1914, which Fisher and other Labor leaders
had attended, countered by anti-Home Rule demonstrations.95 Furthermore, the Senate, where Labor had a
clear majority, had passed a resolution of support (25 to 5) on 25 June 1914:
That, in view of the opinion expressed by the London Times, that “Nothing just now could exercise a more salutary
influence,” in Great Britain, “ than an authoritative pronouncement by the overseas peoples upon the Irish
question,” and accepting that journal as interpreting correctly the feelings of an important section of the
inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland, the Senate desires to reaffirm, and does hereby re-affirm, the Address to
His Majesty the late King, passed on the 23rd November, 1905, as follows : -
“ That, in accordance with the most treasured traditions of British Government and British justice, and for the cementing of the Empire into one
harmonious whole, this Senate is of opinion that Home Rule should be granted to Ireland.”9


At midnight on Tuesday 4 August (central European time)
[Wednesday 5 August in Australia], Britain’s ultimatum to Germany
over its invasion of Belgium expired and therefore Britain and its
Empire were at war.97 Australia received official notification via the
Governor-General just after midday.98 At Britain’s request a small
volunteer force, the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary
Force (AN&MEF), was assembled in August 1914 to invade German
New Guinea and destroy German wireless stations, while New
Zealand occupied the Pacific colony of German Samoa and Japan
declared war on Germany. By October the Japanese naval forces had
seized the German territories of Marianas, the Carolines, Marshall
Islands and Palau in Micronesia.99 Apart from removing a threat on
Australia’s doorstep, the acquisition of German New Guinea fitted
with Australia’s ‘shopping list of colonial conquests’ included in the
1913 ‘General Scheme of Defence’
.
100
On an emotional level, Australia’s automatic entry to the war was
accepted by the Government, the Parliament and the people,
notwithstanding some dissent from the left wing of the labour
movement. As Granville Ryrie (LIB/NAT, North Sydney, NSW) put it:
‘… if the Empire is at war—I do not care what the cause of the quarrel
may be or who created it—we, as an integral part of the British Empire,
are at war and must take our own part in it.’101


Britain was often referred to as the ‘Home Country’, the ‘Mother Country’ or ‘Home’ in parliamentary debates.
For example, in debating the Naval Loan Bill 1909, Charles Frazer (ALP, Kalgoorlie, WA) said:
The British people are already taxed considerably over £1 a head for the naval defence of the Home Country and
the oversea Dominions, while in Australia the Government refuse to add to the taxation of people for defence
purposes, though they now only pay a few paltry shillings per head, and are far better able to pay than those at
Home.102


Parliament at the outbreak of war
Parliament, which had been dissolved on 30 July 1914, was generally considered irrelevant in any decision as to
whether Australia would go to war or remain neutral. This arrangement was not just sentiment—it was
underscored by legal and constitutional arrangements. Australia accepted the authority of the British
Government and its Parliament in such matters. There was no suggestion that the external affairs power in
Australia’s Constitution extended to declaring war.103 As Jonathan Curtis in another Parliamentary Library
research paper puts it:
Notwithstanding that the Australian Constitution provided that the Commonwealth Parliament could legislate with
respect to both defence and external affairs (subsections 51(vi) and (xxix) respectively), and the Executive had the
broader executive power of section 61, the Australian Government knew that the British Imperial Government
remained responsible for the foreign policy of the empire including declarations of war and the power to enter
treaties. This reflected the legal status of all of Britain’s self-governing colonies, which also went to war: Canada,


New Zealand, and South Africa and remained the case in Australia until the enactment of the Statute of
Westminster (Adoption) Act 1943 (Cth).
104
The Government’s role was to decide the nature and extent of Australia’s involvement in the war. It did this
without consulting Parliament, notwithstanding that it was dissolved at the time. Nevertheless, it should be
noted that, on 14 January 1902, Prime Minister Edmund Barton had informed the Parliament that the
Government, without Parliament’s knowledge or approval, had agreed to a request from Britain on
21 December1901 that it send a contingent of 1,000 troops to the Boer War. He explained:
Had this request for troops come to the Government while Parliament was sitting no action would have been taken
without a full opportunity for discussion; though the Government certainly would not have refused—it would have
agreed to send any troops, and would have submitted, if the House was not sitting, its determination to Parliament
afterwards, for honorable members to take such action as they might be advised.105
In 1914, some in the Opposition and the media felt that the situation was serious enough for Parliament to be
recalled before the election. There were even calls for the election to be postponed because there was little
public interest in it and yet it was conceded that there would be even less interest if it was held a few months
later with ‘the clashing of great armies and navies around us’
.
106 On the other hand, it was felt that the election
should be held as soon as possible so that MPs could meet to discuss the situation. As the writs for the election
had already been issued, neither option was likely to occur. Another proposal was for the Parliament to be called
together as a ‘council of the nation’
.
107
On 6 August 1914, Billy Hughes, who would become Australia’s wartime Prime Minister in October 1915,
proposed a novel solution: each party should agree to not oppose sitting members in order to ensure continuity
of government. Parliament could then meet immediately after the election. Alternatively, the proclamation
dissolving Parliament should be revoked, a highly unconstitutional procedure that Hughes argued could be
validated if the British Parliament passed an Indemnity Act.
108
These ideas were not accepted by Cook and the election campaign continued. Labor comfortably won the
election, regaining most of the seats it had lost in 1913. In the House of Representatives Labor held 42 seats to
the Liberals’ 32 and one Independent, and increased its majority in the Senate winning 31 seats to the Liberals’
5. Previously the difference had been 29 to 7. Voter turnout was 73.5%.109
The Sixth Parliament (8 October 1914 to 26 March 1917)
Fisher becomes Prime Minister
Parliament resumed on 8 October 1914 with Fisher as Prime Minister, Hughes as his deputy and Cook as
Opposition Leader. The Governor-General’s speech reiterated the Government’s commitment of troops to the
war. It noted that the Australian Navy had been placed at the disposal of the British Admiralty and that its
presence had ensured that the waters around Samoa and New Guinea had been kept clear of enemy ships.
Nevertheless, it recorded the loss of the Australian submarine AE1 in that campaign. The speech also pledged a
gift of £100,000 to Belgium and outlined proposed wartime measures, such as a pension scheme for Australians
engaged in active service and their dependants, a uniform gauge for the railways and laws relating to trading
with the enemy.110 Even as his Government was immersed in the war crisis, Fisher continued to hope that
Labor’s vision for Australia’s national development and social reform would stand as a model for regenerating the ‘Old Land’: ‘It is enough for us to know that we are a progressive country … that, taking all in all … perhaps
socially the most progressive in the world’

Australia’s engagement begins
The first convoy carrying troops from
the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and
the New Zealand Expeditionary Force
(NZEF) departed from Albany in
Western Australia on 1 November
1914. A little over a week later, on
9 November, one of the escorts, HMAS
Sydney, destroyed the German cruiser
SMS Emden off the Cocos (Keeling)
Islands.112 Two days later the Prime
Minister expressed his delight to the
House. After outlining the nature of
the engagement, he read out some
congratulatory telegrams, including
one from the Secretary of State for the
Colonies, and then said:

There is a host of other telegrams from within Australia and from individuals outside the Commonwealth, but I do
not think I need trouble the House with them. I have only to add that I do not think there is a soul in Australia but
feels very happy indeed that such an opportunity arose, and such a success has followed the first serious naval
action by our own ships.113
Although Labor was in power, it was hardly united. Two strong men, Hughes from NSW and Victoria’s Frank
Anstey (ALP, Bourke, Vic.) were opposed on most issues relating to the war, including the gift to Belgium.
Hughes’ ‘right-wing realism’ was at odds with Anstey’s ‘idealistic socialism’
.
114 Whereas Hughes broadly viewed
the war through the prism of good versus evil, Anstey viewed it as a war between opposing capitalists where the
outcome would be ‘the enslavement of labour’
.
115 Anstey was supported in his opposition to Hughes by Frank
Brennan (ALP, Batman, Vic.), William Maloney (ALP, Melbourne, Vic.) and King O’Malley (ALP, Darwin, Tas.).116
War Precautions Act 1914
Parliament quickly enacted the War Precautions Act 1914 in late October 1914.
117 The Act enabled regulations
to be made by the executive branch of government for the public safety and defence of Australia. As Hughes put
it:
The Bill confers upon the Commonwealth power to make orders and regulations of a far reaching character, and, as
honorable members may see in clauses 4 and 5, is. mainly directed to preventing the leakage of important secrets,
to secure the safety of means of communication, railways, docks, harbors, or public works, and to deal effectively
with aliens, and, in certain circumstances, with naturalized persons. Its aim is to prevent the disclosure of important
information, to give power to deport, and otherwise deal with aliens, to interrogate and obtain information in various ways, and to appoint officers to carry into effect any orders or regulations which may be made under the
Bill.118
Whilst such legislation granting government emergency powers to provide for internal security on the home
front during wartime was not remarkable, ‘in practice it gave the executive extraordinary discretion and
arbitrary power’ over civil society.
119 At the outbreak of war, for example, ‘enemy aliens’ of German or Austrian
birth were required to register with the police and eventually forced into internment.120 Nevertheless, the
Opposition was prepared to trust the Government that these measures were necessary, with Cook saying:
Recognising that these drastic powers are necessary to enable those in our midst, who seek to destroy the integrity
and to injure the interests of the Empire, to be dealt with, I shall give the Government cordial support in passing this
and other measures having that object in view.121
Although this Bill quickly became law, another such Bill (War Precautions Bill 1915) was brought in six months
later in April 1915 on the basis that the 1914 Act was found to be insufficiently detailed to cover the
Government’s exercise of its powers in times of war. In his second reading speech, the Assistant Minister to the
Minister for the Navy, Jens Jensen (ALP, Bass, Tas.), said the Bill:
… concerns chiefly matters of detail, and is intended to fill up gaps which have been found to exist under the
operation of the original Act. It makes it clear that offences against the regulations are punishable on summary
conviction … civilians who are charged under the War Precautions Act shall have the right to trial in a civil Court, a
right now non-existent.122
He praised manufacturers for their cooperation and for accepting the prices at which the Commonwealth had
acquired goods. This legislation closely followed that which was enacted in Britain.123 Opposition Leader Cook
accepted the need for such ‘extraordinary’ powers but cautioned the Government to: ‘Take your Bill; use it
wisely, as no doubt you will; use it, anyhow, in the interests of the country, and for the purpose of securing the
safety and the welfare of its people’
.
124
He wondered if the legislation was constitutional but felt that this was not the time to test that possibility. He
also sought, and received, assurance that the provisions of the Bill would be limited to the duration of the
war.125 James Mathews (ALP, Melbourne Ports, Vic.) was less accepting. He was concerned that freedom of
speech would be curbed by section 4(d) of the Bill which would enable:
The Governor-General [to] make regulations for securing the public safety and the defence of the Commonwealth …
(d) to prevent the spread of false reports or reports likely to cause disaffection to His Majesty or public alarm, or to
interfere with the success of His Majesty’s forces by land or sea, or to prejudice His Majesty’s relations with foreign
powers.
126
Mathews was also concerned that the Bill prevented servicemen, who were required to have matters heard by a
military court, from having the same access as civilians to the civil courts.127 Furthermore, Charles McGrath (ALP,
Ballaarat, Vic.) felt that too much power was being placed in the hands of the military.128 Concern was also expressed that the Bill allowed the Executive to make regulations, thus bypassing Parliament.129 It was also
argued that Australia was not facing a national crisis and that ‘there is no fear of invasion of Australia’
.
130 Hughes
contended that the current war did require such measures but that the Government would not abuse them.131
He further pointed out that in the six months since the enactment of the War Precautions Act there had not
been ‘one instance of an abuse of power’
.
132
Gallipoli
While Parliament was debating these measures, Australian and New Zealand forces landed at Gallipoli on
25 April 1915 as part of an Allied campaign to capture the Gallipoli peninsula. A few days later Fisher informed
the House of this saying: ‘news reaches us that the action is proceeding satisfactorily’. He then read out a
cablegram from the Secretary of State for the Colonies: ‘His Majesty’s Government desire me to offer you their
warmest congratulations on the splendid gallantry and magnificent achievement of your contingent in the
successful progress of the operations at the Dardanelles.’133
He then read out the Government’s reply sent through the Governor-General:
The Government and people of Australia are deeply gratified to learn that their troops have won distinction in their
first encounter with the enemy. We are confident that they will carry the King’s colours to further victory.134

Matters about Gallipoli and Egypt raised in Parliament mainly
focussed on the problem of gaining information about casualties from
that front and the raising of individual cases in which letters from
there had taken a long time to reach their anxious relatives. For
example, Arthur Rodgers (Lib, Wannon, Vic.) said:
The chief object of my rising is to make a suggestion to the Postmaster-
General with regard to communications passing between Australia and
the seat of war, in which we are more directly interested—Gallipoli and
Egypt. I want to ask the Postmaster-General if he and his Government will
take into favorable consideration the question of appointing an officer
directly responsible to the Minister to look after the delivery of all
correspondence and the despatch of all cable matter from the seat of war
to Australia. Hansard is bristling with illustrations of the miscarriage of
communications between relatives in Australia and. soldiers at the front.
Some have been rather heart-rending, mothers and widows having had to
wait six weeks or two months to learn the fate of their relatives.135
The landing at Gallipoli was named Anzac Day in 1916 and marked by
parades, church services and ceremonies which were held in London
as well as Australia. Throughout the war it would be commemorated
in patriotic rallies and used as a means to raise recruiting levels.136 It
received little attention in Parliament except when MPs raised
questions about things that went awry on the day. For example, in
1916 the Minister for the Navy was asked if he had seen a press
report:

… that the officers on board the transport which arrived in Sydney on Thursday last with wounded soldiers
celebrated Anzac Day by sitting down to a sumptuous repast worthy of Lucullus, whilst the rank and file had stew
inflicted upon them three times that day, and were given the privilege of purchasing the menu cards from the
officers’ mess at 6d. each.137
On another occasion, James Fenton (ALP, Maribyrnong, Vic.) wanted to know why the Governor-General had left
‘the saluting base at Parliament House … before the arrival of the bulk of the returned soldiers in the Anzac Day
procession.’138
Federal Parliamentary War Committee
At the end of December 1914 after three months of managing important decisions about the war, an exhausted
Fisher left for New Zealand, encouraged by Hughes, to recuperate for a month. However, he did mix recreation
with some business by taking along some staff, an Opposition MP who was also a friend, and a ‘young political
journalist’ Keith Murdoch.139
In mid-1915, in a show of bipartisanship, the Government established an advisory body consisting of eight
members and four senators, half nominated by the Government and half by the Opposition. The Federal Parliamentary War Committee focussed only on issues referred to it by the Government and dealt mainly with
recruitment and matters facing returned soldiers.140
Fisher wearied of Parliament and resigned on 27 October 1915 after he acceded to pressure from the Australian
Workers’ Union which had sought amendments to the Arbitration Act before Parliament adjourned. However,
this meant that he would have to break an undertaking to Cook that Parliament would be adjourned on
2 September. He apologised for breaking the arrangement, resigned, and went on to become Australia’s High
Commissioner to the United Kingdom in early 1916.141
Hughes becomes Prime Minister
Hughes took over as Prime Minister, retaining the portfolio of Attorney-General and increasing the size of his
ministry to nine. Senator George Pearce (ALP, WA) was his deputy. Hughes pushed on with his earlier attempts
to amend the Constitution in the six areas of trade and commerce (section 51(i)), corporations (section 51(xx)),
industrial matters (section 51(xxxv)), and to empower the Parliament to make laws with respect to railway
disputes, trusts and the nationalisation of monopolies. A polling date was set for December 1915 to hold a prices
referendum. However, he was persuaded that war was not the right time to seek approval from the population
for such wide-ranging powers. Instead, he sought and received agreement from the state premiers (five of
whom were Labor) to refer the necessary powers from the states to the Commonwealth as allowed for under
section 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution. However, as Anstey predicted, the referrals were blocked by the states’
conservative upper houses and never eventuated. Hughes recalled Parliament to reinstate the referendum Bills
but time ran out before he departed via North America for London near the end of January 1916 leaving Pearce
in charge.142 Hughes was heavily criticised within the labour movement for abandoning the prices referendum.
He was called ‘a doddering Tory’ by Labor Call on 9 December 1915 and was almost censured by the Federal
Labor Executive at a special meeting in January 1916.143
Despite these failed attempts to amend the Constitution, in June 1916 the High Court dismissed a challenge to
the War Precautions Act 1914 and its regulations, thereby giving the defence powers under section 51 of the
Constitution a very wide interpretation.144 Hughes was away for seven months and, as Souter has observed, it
was as if he had ‘taken the authority of parliament with him’
.
145 The House sat for only ten days in May and only 32 days for the whole year. In Parliament’s first 15 years it had sat for an average of 88 days per year. Table 6
gives further details of the number of days the House of Representatives sat each year from 1901 to 1918.
Arriving in England on 7 March 1916, Hughes’ energy captured the public imagination. His speeches were
‘electrifying’ and reached a wide audience as he called for increased economic pressure to be put on Germany
and for there to be closer collaboration with Britain’s empire countries.146 He turned for advice to the
aforementioned Keith Murdoch who was in charge of an Australian newspaper cable service. Bypassing his High
Commissioner, Fisher, Hughes dealt directly with the top echelons of the British Government and attended
meetings of its Cabinet and War Committee. He also visited the Western Front in France.147
Hughes returned to Australia reinforced in his conviction that military conscription was necessary if Australia and
the Commonwealth were to be protected and if responsibility was to be shared equitably. He told Parliament at
the end of August 1916:
In view of certain urgent and grave communications from the War Council of Great Britain, and of the present state
of the war, and the duty of Australia in regard thereto, and as a result of long and earnest deliberation, the
Government have arrived at the conclusion that the voluntary system of recruiting cannot be relied upon to supply
that steady stream of reinforcements necessary to maintain the Australian Expeditionary Forces at their full
strength.148
He then went on to spell out the exact nature of the problem:
The number of reinforcements required for next month is 32,500, and subsequently 16,500 a month. The number of
recruits for June was 6,375; July, 6,170; and up to 23rd August, 4,144; or a total of 16,689. The most recent list for
eleven days shows the number of casualties to be 6,743. These figures speak for themselves. They show that the
position which confronts the Government, the Parliament, and the people, is that while it is our clear duty to keep
the number of our Forces up to their full strength, the stream of recruits under the voluntary system has fallen to
less than one-third of what is necessary.149
Hughes was initially inclined to bring about conscription through an Act of Parliament as had been done in
Britain and New Zealand. However, he soon realised that this path might not guarantee success. There was
much opposition from within his own side of politics and from the trade union movement which saw
conscription as a human rights issue and as a way of reducing working conditions. Introducing conscription
through regulation may also have been problematic as there was no guarantee Hughes could rely on the
Executive Council and the Senate might disallow such a regulation.150
Military Service Referendum Bill
This left a plebiscite as the only option.151 Hughes introduced the Military Service Referendum Bill on
13 September 1916 and exacerbated the split within the Labor Party which had been apparent from late 1915.
Trade and Customs Minister, Frank Tudor (ALP, Yarra, Vic.), resigned the next day, with three other ministers
doing likewise before the October plebiscite. The Bill finally passed Parliament on Saturday 23 September with
the plebiscite to be held on 28 October 1916.
The emotive plebiscite campaign over conscription divided Australian society, with various motivations fuelling
the arguments both for and against. For example, those who supported conscription claimed that it would be
the most effective means of building a force large enough to quickly and decisively win the war.152 Additionally,
pro-conscriptionists contended that conscription would ensure equality of sacrifice in the war effort, and cited
New Zealand’s introduction of conscription as a position to emulate to maintain fairness and Australia’s own
self-respect.153


Regarding the anti-conscriptionist cause, their arguments included a strong aversion to citizens being forced to
serve in an overseas conflict against their will and without consultation, as well as fears that conscription would
lead to requirements for female, child and immigrant labour.154
The question put to the people on 28 October was: ‘Are you in favour of the Government having, in this grave
emergency, the same compulsory powers over citizens in regard to requiring their military service, for the term
of this war, outside the Commonwealth, as it has now in regard to military service within the
Commonwealth?’155
The answer was ‘No’ overall, by a margin of 72,476 votes (3.22%) and ‘No’ in three states (NSW, Queensland and
South Australia). Of the members of the AIF who cast formal votes, 72,399 (55.14%) voted in favour of
conscription and 58,894 (44.86%) voted against it.1

At the next Caucus meeting on 14 November 1916, Hughes’ leadership was challenged. His response was to
demand that those who supported him to follow him out of the room. Thirteen members and 11 senators from
a caucus of 64 did so. This group decided to act as a separate party (later named the National Labor Party) and to
support Hughes’ new ministry. Hughes gained the support of the Liberals as long as he concentrated on the war
effort. Governor-General Munro Ferguson accepted that Hughes could continue to govern and granted him a
commission to form a new government.
158
In December 1916, a special conference of the Labor Party expelled all those who had supported conscription. In
early 1917 Hughes formed a fusion/coalition with the Liberals led by Joseph Cook. Hughes needed the electoral
organisation of an established party and the Liberals needed to avoid an early election as they would be
hampered by the ‘No’ vote in the plebiscite. They agreed to support Hughes as Prime Minister as long as he tried
to extend Parliament to October 1918 or six months after the end of the war, whichever came sooner.159
Parliament resumed on 8 February 1917 and Hughes’ third ministry was sworn in on 17 February. Hughes sought
to make good his undertaking to extend the life of the Parliament. This could only be done through changing the
Constitution or by an amendment of the Commonwealth Constitution Act in the United Kingdom Parliament. The
former course of action required a referendum which, given the electorate’s recent propensity to reject changes,
was not considered to be a viable option.
The latter course required a resolution to be passed by both Houses before a proposed amendment could be
voted on in the British Parliament.160 The resolution which passed the House of Representatives on 2 March by
34 votes to 17 votes was:
Whereas, by reason of the existence of a state of war, and by reason of the immediate meeting of an Imperial
Conference for the discussion of questions of paramount importance to the Commonwealth and to the British
Empire, it is imperatively necessary that the forthcoming elections for both Houses of the Parliament of the Commonwealth should be postponed: And whereas, in the existing circumstances, this can only be effected by an
Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom: Now therefore this House resolves: That the Imperial Government be
requested to provide by legislation for the extension of the duration of the present House of Representatives until
the expiration of six months after the final declaration of peace, or until the 8th day of October, 1918, whichever is
the shorter period, and for such provision in relation to the terms of senators and the holding of Senate elections as
will enable the next elections for the Senate to be held at the same time as the next general election for the House
of Representatives, and consequential adjustments to be made regarding subsequent elections.161
However, the numbers were against Hughes in the Senate, 20 to 16. As ‘luck’ would have it, three of Tasmania’s
four Labor senators were in poor health. So, the Government sent one (Senator James Long (ALP, Tas.)) off to
the Dutch East Indies on a trade mission, another (Senator James Guy, (ALP, Tas.)) reported from hospital his
inability to attend Parliament, and the third (Senator Rudolph Ready, (ALP, Tas.)) tendered his resignation after
being alarmed by a fainting episode in Parliament House two days earlier.
With Ready resigning at 6 pm on 1 March, Hughes immediately sought to fill the casual vacancy with someone
who would support his resolution. In a series of events worthy of the script for any modern day political drama,
he had his man, John Earle, former Premier of Tasmania, ready to be sworn in when the Senate met the
following morning. However, two Tasmanian Liberal senators (Thomas Bakhap and John Keating), affronted by
what they viewed as an attack on their state, indicated that they would vote against the resolution. Hughes’
manoeuvrings had come to nought and there was no point in putting the resolution to a vote.
Commonwealth Electoral (War-time) Act 1917
With an election having been called but with Parliament yet to be dissolved, the Commonwealth Electoral (War-
time) Act 1917 was passed on 17 March.162 The Act applied specifically to elections held during the war and for
six months after it had ended. All members of the forces of voting age, including munitions and other workers,
and Army nurses, serving overseas at the time of an election were entitled to vote irrespective of whether or not
they were enrolled. This could be in the division in which they resided, or else in the division in which their next
of kin resided. Such electors would vote for either the ‘Ministerialist’
, that is, the Government or the opposition
party, rather than for a candidate. Their votes would thus be counted as a vote for the candidates (Senate) or
candidate (House of Representatives) from the chosen party in the division in which they were judged to be
voting. The Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition were to designate their party candidates in each
division or state. This model, as Patrick Glynn MP noted in his second reading speech, was based on the
Canadian system: ‘As the ordinary electoral method cannot be followed, it is proposed to allow our men abroad to
vote for definite groups, that is, for Ministerialists, or for Oppositionists, as they choose.
’163
Initially, the Government did not intend for the Act to cover munition workers who had been invited ‘Home’ by
the Imperial Government because, although they were on lists, and could be regarded ‘as associated with our
Military Forces’, they were ‘so scattered about that it would be very difficult to provide machinery’ to enable
their vote to be registered.164 People who worked on the transport ships were also to be excluded from the
provisions of the Act because ‘their names are not on official lists, most of them will be at sea when the vote is
taken, and, in any case, their votes could not easily be allocated to particular districts’
.
165 Munition workers who
went to Britain of their own accord were also to be excluded because their names were not known.166
However, the Opposition asked that Australians working in the larger munition and ship-building factories in
Britain be included in the provisions of the Bill. The Opposition also sought to have the names of the candidates
on the ballot paper, not just the parties (‘Ministerial’ or ‘Opposition’), or at least have the names more readily
available to each soldier than just having a list of candidates distributed amongst them. Another complicating
factor was that before the split in the Labor Party in 1916, over 100,000 men had gone overseas and were unlikely to have closely followed the political situation back in Australia.167 Adding to the possible confusion was
the fact that there had been three changes of government, three ministries and three oppositions since the war
began.
During debate on the Bill it was pointed out that these provisions only applied to soldiers aged 21 or older as
that was the voting age at the time. As William McWilliams (NAT, Franklin, Tas.) protested: ‘A young man who is
old enough to fight for his country ought to be considered old enough to vote at elections for the Parliament of
his country.’168
The Government responded that giving all overseas soldiers the vote would involve changing the electoral law
and that the extended franchise would be withdrawn at the end of the war. Minister for Home and Territories,
Patrick Glynn, said: ‘I think that it is better to keep the Bill strictly to its original object, which is to prevent those
at the front from being deprived of their existing rights.’169
The Act also prevented naturalised British subjects born in enemy territory from voting unless they had arrived
in Australia from France, Italy or Denmark before those countries became part of Germany or Austria. An
electoral official could check the bona fides of prospective voters by asking them: ‘Are you a naturalized British
subject who was born in an enemy country within the meaning of the Commonwealth Electoral (War-time) Act
1917?’170
1917 election (5 May)
Parliament was dissolved on 26 March and elections were held on 5 May 1917. The election campaign was all
about the war. Hughes campaigned for the seat of Bendigo with the slogan ‘Win the War’, accompanied by three
Win the War Senate candidates.
171 He railed against those who profiteered from the war and proposed a tax on
war profits and the continuation of controls on prices. His ‘populate or perish’ message was largely directed at
the country constituency for whom he promised a soldier settlement scheme for those returning from the war.
Frank Tudor led Labor, also pledging to win the war but without conscription. He too put forward benefit
schemes for returned servicemen. The six constitutional amendments put before the people in 1913 would
again be presented to them.
Hughes decided not only to move electorates, but also states, as he moved from West Sydney which was
staunchly Labor to Bendigo (Victoria) which was marginally so.172 He denied there would be another referendum
on conscription ‘unless Australia and the Empire were threatened with disaster’
.
173
Hughes’ Nationalists won the election handsomely gaining 53 lower house seats to Labor’s 22. They also won all
18 Senate seats up for election, which brought their total to 24 seats compared to Labor’s 12.
The election also saw the end of King O’Malley’s (ALP, Darwin, Tas.) parliamentary career as he was defeated,
and those of two German-born MPs, George Dankel (Nationalist, Boothby, SA) and Jacob Stumm (Liberal, Lilley,
Qld) who retired. Three female candidates again failed to win election, the same outcome for the female
candidates at the two previous elections.174
The seventh Parliament (14 June 1917 to 11 November 1918)
Parliament opened on 14 June 1917 in order to elect a new Speaker (William Johnson) and pass two supply bills.
It was then prorogued until 11 July and the swearing in of 18 new senators. However, both houses met
unofficially on 15 June to discuss recruitment for the war.


Hughes had sought to dispense with the Governor-General’s opening speech outlining his Government’s
program because he was not fully ready. However, this was resisted by the Governor-General and the program
was presented. A committee composed of members from both sides of politics would aid the Director-General
of Recruiting to obtain the 7,000 volunteers a month who were needed to maintain Australia’s five infantry
divisions in the war at full strength. The income tax rate would be increased and there would be a tax on war
time profits. Industrial action that would adversely affect the war effort would be prevented through
amendments to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904. The Government’s unpreparedness
was exposed when the Opposition did not engage in the Address-in-Reply debate and Hughes was forced to
adjourn the House for a week to work on the details of its measures.175
Meanwhile, the war was taking its toll on the industrial front with a general strike over August and September
involving workers from the tramways, railways, waterfront and mines, as well as civil demonstrations, such as
Melbourne’s food riots where crowds assembled on a daily basis to denounce profiteering while the people
starved.
176 Dissatisfaction was expressed in an economic climate of rising prices, wage differences, war profits
and high interest rates on war loans. Hughes saw the disturbance in political terms blaming it on the infiltration
of the International Workers of the World (IWW)—an international revolutionary movement which opposed the
war—and the Irish into Labor organisations and their unwillingness to accept their electoral defeat. Although the
IWW, known as the ‘Wobblies’, did not pose a serious political threat in Australia, Hughes and other pro-
conscriptionists had come to view their activities as subversive. In 1916, for example, twelve IWW leaders in
NSW were arrested and tried for forgery, treason, felony, conspiracy and arson following a series of suspicious
fires in Sydney. They were all found guilty and received prison sentences, but Hughes sought to destroy the
movement entirely.177 In December 1916, he introduced the Unlawful Associations Bill, declaring to Parliament
that the IWW had: ‘… declared war upon society; upon the people of this country … this organization holds a
dagger at the heart of society … As it seeks to destroy us, we must in self defence destroy it’
.
178
The resulting legislation criminalised the organisation, but it did not completely destroy it. In July 1917, the
Commonwealth Parliament passed amendments to the Unlawful Associations Act 1916 to make it an offence to
be a member of such an organisation in Australia.
179 At the peak of the industrial unrest in 1917, Hughes wrote
to the British Prime Minister, Lloyd George, expressing his views on the impact that such international
movements were having on the Australian home front: ‘The Irish have captured the political machinery of the
Labor organisations—assisted by the Syndicalists and IWW people … One of their archbishops—Mannix—is a
Sinn Feiner’
.
180 These sentiments may have been an exaggeration, yet they were also understandable. Just two
days prior to penning his letter there had been a large demonstration outside Parliament House led by Labor
supporter and suffragette, Adela Pankhurst, aiming to reduce the cost of living and free up supplies of basic food
items. This was contrary to a government regulation prohibiting such demonstrations within a large area around
the building, and Pankhurst was subsequently arrested.181
Pressure was also building on a reluctant Hughes who had made an election promise not to reconsider
conscription. There had been heavy losses on the Western Front as Germany had been able to focus its forces
there. This followed the October Revolution by the Bolsheviks in Russia which took it out as a force against
Germany. Apart from the heavy casualties (38,000 between August and November), voluntary enlistment was
well below the required 7,000 per month.182 America had adopted conscription when it entered the war in April.
Canada had done so too in October by an Act of Parliament. There had even been a suggestion by Sir William
Irvine (Nationalist, Flinders, Vic.) that the UK Parliament pass legislation for conscription in Australia. Hughes
decided that the seriousness of the war situation warranted him breaking his promise. As Parliament was not
