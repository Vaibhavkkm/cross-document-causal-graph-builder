Text:  Dearest Mother & all at Home, I have just received another batch of letter & papers from you & others in Melb, but the parcel which Mab wrote about is not to hand yet, but I expect it is here & somewhere. I am glad you enjoyed your holiday at Creswick as the change will have done you good. It must be a great blessing that  the rain came when it did. We have the most delightful weather here & have had only 2 wet days since we landed exactly a month ago. Yesterday was a holiday. The Turks put up the White Flag & came in from Gaba Tepe & wanted an Armistice of 24 hours to bury their dead & attend to their wounded. Our people granted them 8 hours & during this time they buried 2,000 odd. Our fellows all went down for a swim & the beach resembled Hampton on a holiday. The day before yesterday was a little exciting for the men on the H.M.S. Albion. All the Men of War have to keep moving now as there is an hostile submarine kicking around, & she got to near & went aground. The Turks opened fire on her & she had to fight for her life & poured hundreds of broad sides into the Turks & as she thus lightened herself & a rope was passed to her from the “Vengeance”, she towed off after being aground for 4 hours. Things are very quiet here now & we only have to hold our  
Hope Chas has got work.
Tell George to write soon ground until the British Division advance, & we are only allowed to fire very little as our Infantry & their machine guns can hold the Turks easily. We have had only one casualty since I last wrote to you, so this goes to show you how slow things are. The Turks shrapnel is a little annoying at times, but as you can hear it coming, one can generally get under cover. A German Aeroplane came over us & dropped a couple of bombs yesterday & killed one of the Infantry chaps. We get plenty of food & clothes & a good variety too, Cigarettes & Tobacco are issued to us once a week (2 packets & 1 tin of tobacco each) & Rum is also allotted, but this doesn't interest me. My gun is not repaired yet, but it will not be long away as they are repairing it on the "Prince of Wales". Our guns did good work the other night when the Turks made a night attack which was repulsed with heavy loss We shelled them vigorously for an hour & the Colonel congratulated our Major on the good work. General Bridges died of his wounds & is buried at Alexandria I believe. I received a letter from May Tilton, Mab, Nell Wheeler, Paper from Creswick, 2 "Ages", & one from Mother, also one from Ruby Davidson. I have no time or materiel to write to them, so would be obliged if you could acknowledge their kindness. I am in the best of health & thoroughly enjoying the experience & hope to be in Constantinople soon. Hope all are well at home. Kindest love to everybody & an extra whack for yourself I remain Your loving son Norman.
