 I am now off to the Base Commandants with the papers - Found the Base Commdt. Gen McGregor at Mustapha after waiting some time I was informed that I would be notified in due course and that a boat was leaving on Saturday next. Visited Mayers & got in to a new suit I had ordered there Had photo taken & left instructions for them to be sent home. Went out to German hospital. (Deaconesses hospital) and saw Major Mason had a long yarn with him; he is improving fast & hopes to be fit again in about a fortnight.  I saw Capt Finlayson he does not look well at all, poor old Fin he will be in bed for a long time yet I'm afraid I had a long talk 
with him, Left 7.15 pm for the Windsor where I dined royally
