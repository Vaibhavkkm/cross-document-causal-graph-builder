25th APRIL, 1915 
ADELAIDE, Tuesday. Private Whyte, who died from wounds re- ceived in the Dardanelles fighting on April  29, was a popular local sportsman. In 1909  he was stroke for the South Australian eight- oared rowing crew who went to Melbourne,  and the following year he went to Brisbane.  In 1911 he again stroked for an eight-oared  crew in Sydney. He will also be sadly  missed in lacrosse circles. For the past 12  years he was prominent in that pastime.  He played for South Australia in interstate  matches in 1909, 1910, 1911, and 1912.
