 Gaba Tepe, Gallipoli Peninsular, Turkey, 15th June 1915.  Dearest Mother & all at Home, Just a few lines to let you know that I am quite well & in the very best of "nick" & am thoroughly enjoying this great experience. We have got the Turks beaten now, & they only confine themselves to repelling our attacks. We completely beat them at night fighting, because we can fire our guns at night just as easily as in daytime, & they dare not fire theirs, as it would give away their positions, so you see we have things all our own way at this game. You will be pleased to know that our battery has been mentioned in despatches for gallantry & The Major expects to get out of it, & there are 2 D. C. Ms to go to the battery. We drew for them out of the hat & we decided to give one to one of the chaps on "C" Subsection who has a big chance of losing his leg & the other went to Corporal Gammon (Yardleys corporal). The Turks use high explosive shell on us now, & one of these came through the front of the pit, glanced along the gun barrel & burst through the shield; The gun layer was killed instantly & the fuze hit the other man on the leg. This was therefore put  completely out of action & they made up a new gun out of mine which was walloped on my birthday, & some of the 
of the spare undamaged parts of Adams gun, so the result is, My old gun is completely rebuilt & is barking louder than ever & my detachment are just the boys to work her too. All the Drivers & horses are still in Alexandria & of course Braithwaite & Jack Hall are there too, so it looks as if they will keep us in Gaba Tepe after the advance has begun. No body is anxious to see Constantinople here, as it resembles Cairo only much dirtyr dirtier & smelly, so we don't want to go there. You will be sorry to hear about Yardley; He has got a complete nervous breakdown & has been struck off our strength & sent to the Divisional Ammunition Column at Alexandria. One of his detachment got killed one day & poor Yardley took it quite heart & let it get him down. It doesn't do, Mother, to let it get one down at this game & when a chap gets killed, you simply have to lift him out of his seat, throw a coat over his head, & go on working the gun just as if nothing has happened. It seems hard, but it can't be helped. Down at Cape Helles, the British & French are bombarding the place night & day & it is one continuous roar all the time. We don't get so much assistance from the Navy now, as the Submarines sunk two battleships last week. We were only ½ a mile from where the "Triumph" went down, & so of course we saw the whole  
show. "Hostile submarine" was signalled to all ships & all the battleships "up anchor" & kept moving about all the time, except the "Triumph" who was content to remain at Anchor & put out her nets, but as you know, torpoedos cut through nets, & the poor old "Triumph" found out too late, for the torpoedo struck her fair amidships & we at once saw her with sloping decks & a big list to starboard, & all the sailors were all "fallen in" as on parade on the after deck. Boats of all sorts were sent to her assistance, & we saw a race of destroyers from Cape Helles & they were doing 35 knots an hour, & reached her before she went down. Slowly she heeled over & all the sailors got on to her side which was above water & then they all leapt into the sea & were picked up by the boats. She turned right over at last & showed her propellers & then went slowly to the bottom. During this time, the Turks wher were shelling the rescue parties & men in the water, but their shooting was poor. We only have Destroyers along the coast now, but occasionly the Fleet steams out of Lemnos at night & shells the Turks along the coast at day break for a couple of hours & then gets away to Lemnos again. The battleship "Albion" went aground off Gaba Tepe one night, & the Vengance was trying to tow her off. But the 
only way she could get off, was to lighten herself of shells so she pumped out 200 broadsides of 6 inch guns into the Turks territory, & what a sight it was too, she was one mass of smoke & flashes & the noise was deafening. She was towed off however after an hours shelling. Les Ilsley is with the New Zealanders & was in the last bayonet charge & came out all right. He rang me up on the 'Phone. The Turks wont face the bayonet & run like blazes. Their artillery too, can't shoot for nuts; The first shot usually falls 50 yards in front of our guns, & the next goes miles over our heads into the sea, the next falls to the right or left & the next may hit the pit itself. & after this it is quite safe to sit on the roof & watch for the rest, nevertheless we don't take any risks. There is two shells in front of my gun 27½ inches long & 8½ inches in diameter (unexploded) so you see we get some little visitors occasionly. They must be short of ammunition, because a lot of their shells are filled with pitch & sawdust. Our conditions are quite the best available & we get the best of food, Fresh meat, Onions, Spuds, Fresh Bread, & dried fruits, Etc. so I am getting condition on again. I am often thinking of everybody at home & I earnestly hope that you don't worry about me, because I am quite alright I have been hit twice with shrapnel bullets & altho' they were fairly spent, nevertheless it is just like getting hit with a stone, thrown very swiftly. One can hear shells coming, & so we can generally manage to get our heads under cover, even if our back sides don't, & strange to say, this is just where I was struck each time. High explosive shells are only dangerous when they actually hit the gun & the men are working it, but we are always ordered into "funk holes" as soon as we finish firing. How is everybody at home, Give my love to all enquirers & tell them to be proud of the Australian Infantry for the way they took this place. All the Imperial Officers swear by them now. I hope you are well, Mum. Give my love to Mab, Chas & family (hope he is in work) George, Rupert, Floss, Miss Taylor, Jack Tilton & all relations. We are always delighted to get your letters from home also the papers & I read them over & over again. I got the socks & handkerchiefs from Mab, thanks so very much, if you could send me a singlet or two, I should feel obliged, we get shirts & pants & coats & boots, but no singlets. Well, good bye, for the present, with best love to all I remain Your loving Son Norman
