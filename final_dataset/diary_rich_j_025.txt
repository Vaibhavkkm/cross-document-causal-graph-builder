Tuesday Oct. 27th
We are anchored in
St Georges Sound with 22 others
Albany seems to be some miles
away and through the narrow
opening between the huge grand
granite rocks that make
decent sized Islands.
The fellows would like to
get on land but are fairly
patunt patient and seem to be getting
much more contented with the
food & general ship life.
I can see another 7 or 8 weeks
of it and quite prepared to put
get through the monotony
and confinement of it all.
I posted an article to Hollingworth
for publication in one,
or any, of the papers the Herald
for preference.
I wrote a 9 page letter to May Fpench she won't
know what to make of me
as there is a story. I overheard
between the infantry men so
ful of swearing. I gave
her a lot on Astronomy and
scenic beauties also.
To W.Z.B. I wrote six pages
and confessed much of my xxx
longing for her, and at the same
time giving her liberty to get
another man; if he is a man,
I won't grumble. I would
not say this, but how is it
possible for me to offer anything
in the way of comfort and
convenience. Yet it will come
hard to part with her, and
I cannot keep her waiting
for what may be a forlorn
hope. When I reason coldly
Win is no good to me, but my
heart won't agree and seeks her wildly.
 
I am with Mess No. 52. E.
in charge of Corporal Gregg Donnellan
and consists of 20 men, two
of whom are appointed permanent
mess orderlies they draw the
food and serve it up from
the head of the table. As they
have hard work to do we each
put in ½d per week and give
them 10/- each. They are
Hucking and O'Sullivan.
The first named is an raw
North of Englishmen and a rather
slow thinking, dull witted type
he carries the troubles of the whole
mess on his heavily burdened
shoulders, and is in his most
congenial mood when he can
get the fellows asking for things
he then airs his officiousness
in a majestic manner. To grool
growl is a special delight, and
to be short of food, and complain
of the fellows eating too much is a boom to him. His off-sider,
O'Sullivan, has been a much
sworn at fellow every since he
joined the ranks, that is
now 8 weeks ago. and he
cannot march in step to save
his life. I thought it quite
impossible for any man not
to learn his right leg or hand
from the left after having an
instructor and everybody who
marches behind him calling
out 20 times each parade
Yet "Sully" is a cheerful
optimistic sort of fellow
without a hard word to say
about anyone; though I have
heard him telling Hacking
he was worst, worse than
an old woman and that he
was full of working with him
Sully is left-handed and can
never serve out either the
 
porridge or the tea evenly, the
first few plates are filled up
then the quantity decreases until
the last few get but very little
and a possibility of nothing at
all being left for himself.
This often occurs and then it
is a funny pantomint pantomime to hear
Hacking and Sully in wordy
warfare. Sully is always
satisfied, the other man is never
so; Although he is surprisingly
consciencious he is extreml
extremely jealous.
I just had a glass of beer
in the Sargents mess they have
a barrel there and are allowed
a glass three times a day.
The Sargents mess cost 3/6
per day the privates 1/9.
I am on guard to-day.
Dressed in full uniform we are
on 4 hours and off 8 hours but
we must remain in the stuffy guard
room all day long. Wednesday.
