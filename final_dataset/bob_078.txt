My dear Lorna, Have left hospital at last and am at large in London staying at this pub. Have been up for my medical board declared fit for general service and received 14 days leave not very much after 6 months in hospital still I knew it and took
some leave before being discharged from hospital by arrangement with the Sister who was a great sport. Guess I could have had light duty in England for another 3 months or so if I had liked but want to get back again now they asked me how far I could walk without feeling it told them 20 miles of course I don't know but think the leg is quite strong 
again now it is a bit wasted but suppose will pick up eventually. Of course shall make the best of my time in London now if money holds out am just going up to the bank to find out how much I have left somewhere about £50 I am hoping 
which should just about pull me through have no credit in my pay book have spent a terrible lot of money in this town having had £160 from Australia and drawn £140 from my pay book still who cares considering the all I have seen and the truly wonderful time I have had would not have missed it for £1,000 which no doubt it would have
cost in peace times Am keen to see London now when peace is declared all light up and everything going the comparison would be rather interesting I think dont you. Reckon I shall be back here again in about 3 months if not pushing daisies a fellow is sure
to get another crack in this next push which I shall run right into War news seems brighter Germans retreating on part of the line but he is a wily old bird I am a bit suspicious still shall be surprised if the stunt does not finish this year sincerely hope so am getting sick of the whole show shall be glad to get home again Am going down to see the Henleys to-day with Ralf Kell after a free
lunch you know am a naughty boy have not been to see them for weeks but I always seem to have something else to do much more interesting however must ask the girls to have dinner and theatre afterwards one night before I go away they have been very kind to
me What do you think of Nana's stunt it is great him being across here for so long    back to civilisation and a  good time again   hope he will be able to get down to London and see me before I go   would like to show him round a bit reckon I know all about this city now and one can have a much better time if you know where to go and what to do where to be careful etc etc. what sayest thou?
Went up to Cambridge to see him one week end but shall not enlarge guess he has written and given you all the news Had quite a gay time yesterday and last night had breakfast about 10.30 went for a walk up Regent St into Oxford St bought a valise at Selfridges you know the big American
Store then through Marble Arch into Hyde Park out at  Hyde Park Corner back into Piccadilly met a Scotch Officer at the Carlyle Club (a bosca little club I belong  to) had a couple of drinks then went to Scotts for lunch had some oysters & stout later met Humphrey Browning went down to his flat met about 10 Australians there had yarns and many whiskies to boot about 7 o'clock went back to the club 
to met a nice little Jane took her to dinner and had a real evening out do not know how Sydney will hold me if lucky enough to get back however we shall worry about that when it comes along Well old kid had better dry up or I shall be rambling on and putting
my foot in it and telling you all sorts of funny things shall reserve them until I get back   lots of love for the kid Jack and your old self, Bobbie.

 Shall store my stuff at Cooks London before going away in case I get outed you will know how to get it back home few old dirty clothes etc some papers, maps etc that might be of interest am leaving a brown box suit case and black kit bag in London just taking a valise across to France this time.
