CHURCH OFFICE, PERTH, WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
4-6-1917  Dear General The papers today tell us that the King has given  you another honour & I just send this line to let you know how delighted your friends are. Some how when you get an honour we think it partly belongs tous so we are the more pleased- you & our 
men deserve & deserve  richly every honour you get - I wish you could  finish the job & get into the Land & have a rest. That however is not yet - I have just come from speaking at a recruiting meeting - we are doing pretty well - but not as  well as we could wish. If we could win the war by talk - I should be doing  my share - for I have spoken on the war over 40 times since I got back.
I cannot get over the ‘Gypy Tummey’ I got in Egypt - it makes one  very weak - Please remember me to all your staff - How good they were to me! - Yours with hearty congratulations,  C.N. Perth.
