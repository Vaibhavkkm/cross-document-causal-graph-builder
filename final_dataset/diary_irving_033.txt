Weather: fair Health: good
Paid at 6:15 - $12.00 No deduction for insurance.
Up at 6:00. Breakfast, oatmeal, steak, coffee. Inspection. Outside with new hats, belts, rifles. Drill in firebreak. Lt. Cook reprimanded by Lieut. Boniface for our appearance. Some men have hat with 1 earlap down, other up. Ragged appearance all the way down the line. Good humored exchange between Lieuts. Frequent rests but work is grueling. Sgt. Childs has moving picture – in recreation room where I am anxious to go to look for letters from Leah and packages. Dinner, beef stew, prunes. Hardly time to wash my mess kit when whistle blows for drill. Turn out by squads. Lieut. Cook tells us we are to be paid today. A fine incentive for work. Letter from Leah with affidavit enclosed. Then a telegram from Leah which is disappointing. She is in great difficulties in shop. I do not know what to do since one does not work with other. Sam tells me of a fight with Sweet. Retreat. Supper, macaroni and cheese, canned peaches, cocoa. Read and nap. 8:00 to the K of C to phone Leah. See prize fight for first time. Leah has bad news to tell me about things in the shop. I give her encouragement and then I go back to barracks. I go to orderly room but cannot stand air. Read for a while and downstairs in mess hall to write to Leah and Lou until 10:30. I have noticed that I find it impossible to think and write and at the least interruption my mind is diverted, so I go to bed. Sleep well. 15 men transferred from Company to supply train to fill vacancies caused by men being sent to France last Monday. These men return at night for pay but do not get it.
