November 17th.   Friday.  
Day in Amiens.  Centigrade 6 points. It was very bleak and cold at 7 a.m. I got to Harry Dingle by 8 o'clock and by a big motor waggon we went rumbling along the Albert-Amiens straight tree-lined road, getting into the city before 11 a.m. A haircut and shave and a good hot bath, 1 franc & ½, gave us a better appetite for dinner than the best dinner we really could find. Very disappointing indeed. It took us until 5 o'clock to shop. I bought a cap, 20 francs; putties 15 francs; leather buttons 2 francs; cigarette case, metal, 2 francs½; soap box, tooth brushes, tooth powder 9 francs. Dingle did more shopping than I. We had a gin and vermouth before looking out for dinner, in the American Bar. The dining room was closed at the Savoy (officers only). The Tommy traffic man, who never had a square meal in his life (as his judgment proved) directed us to a place. We wanted a full course dinner. At 3 o'clock we went into a place and had a whole lobster - 16 - between us with a small bottle of beer, and bread and butter; 14 francs. 4½ francs in London and Sydney. Later two whiskeys cost 2½ francs and the waiter battled hard for his tip. Now we can buy whiskey at 4 and 5 francs a bottle so you can guess I felt hurt!! I bought 5 bottles of whiskey for the fellows at Longueval. We visited some rather fine cafes which were all full up with French soldiers and officers; a few women were there, but very few indeed. The Cathedral is a splendid monument. The architecture  is very handsome but the building material is of poor quality, and taking it all around I was very disappointed indeed. We were home at 10 o'clock, left Amiens 8 p.m. (23 kilos).
