11 September 1915 at sea Dear family Still going without any land in sight and the weather very hot but sea without a ripple. Some time back just after entering the Indian Ocean a large wave broke over the bow of the ship and broke our hatch & flooded our mess deck for the time being we all got wet through rifles kit bags plates boots & other things all floating about one of our chaps was carried off his feet & hurt his head having to have about 18 stitches in same. We all more or less got a bit of a scare but it was some experience I dried off in the stoke hold. of course we lost a lot of gear & it all meant a lot of work cleaning rusty rifles etc. Wara & self OK except for a bit of a cold same one has stuck to me since leaving Sydney. Expect to arrive at destination in about middle of Sept. Love Bob.
