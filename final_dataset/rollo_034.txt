First Stunt. who tumbled to what was up, & attacked I had my men extended over a large area - & gave orders ‘no firing’ till I gave word. Turks crept up & began sniping diggers from about 25 yds ahead - that was queer to see [*23.6.15.*] the blue flashes a few feet in front - & to feel the wind of bullets passing close by.  The Major in charge of diggers told me - he wondered where we’d got to - as I didn’t open fire till late.  Anyhow I gave signal for "5 rounds rapid".  My word there was a scatter - & the Turks - about 100 - cleared taking dead & wounded with them.  We followed up a short distance - taking position on crest of the hill - from on which however we were exploded by a machine gun. We got back to our old cover without loss somehow or other. - We were supposed to be out from 9.30 to 2.30 - but Major did not withdraw diggers till 3.30 a.m. so we had to stay till they got in.  Then came my job in half-daylight to get my men back safely.  Frontage 200 yds. & every sniper & rifle about - seemed to search this from the 75 yds we had to retire - but 11th & 10th in old
fire trench - opened a heavy ‘rapid’ and I took advantage - rushed the men back - & got in with only two casualties - Jackson (in stom.) & Corp. Phyllis (foot) neither serious. [*June 23.*] When I got back I was ‘roused at’ for staying out too long - but I’d have been court-mtld. if I’d come in before Major Brockman’s diggers.  The Junior- sub. - gets all the Kicks. This was my first independent command - but I got through O.K. - and I am looking forward to my next stunt. Holmes died today.  Ireland is in C. Co. 27. 6. 15 A padre passed 100 envelopes & sheets to Col Weir & I’ve had luck to get a sheet or two - so I am able to write in style & enclose some letters for you to send on [*27. 6. 15*] Situation here unchanged - except 11th have made secure their new trench.  Jacko has got some ‘Taubes’, & promises to make things unpleasant for us, until we get them.  They had the neck to drop messages advising us “to surrender - as you are being misled by England who is on her last legs.” Also they assert they could push us into the sea at any time.  I only wish they would try that game. 
Stan. Ireland is transferred - so he & I are together & share the same “pozzie”. We are getting quite luxurious now; we got friendly with some officers on the store-ships who make us pay through the nose for what we do get.  Four of us agreed to get some pickles, sauce, oatmeal &c the other day. Cornish was the buyer. For 30/- (or 7/6 each) we got 6 bottles pickles, 6 sauce, 3 Worcester, 7lb oatmeal & 1 small packet of cocoa. 1lb coffee, & 6 tins mixed jam.  I thought this was rather a hot price, - but still we might as well get the things whilst we have the chance - & the cash. Today Cornish has gone to the Hosp. Ship to fix up some of Holmes’ business - & also to try & get some soap (for cleaning clothes) & some chocolate too. I only brought 6 pair sox from Egypt - left others in trunk - transport accommodation is not what it was in the Boer War - so I’m economising.  I’m keeping 4 pair for emergencies, & wearing the other two turn about - Getting quite an old soldier’s way - eh? Anyhow 6 pairs won’t last long here if we stay - (I candidly believe we’ll be away in 6 or 8 weeks) - so send along a pair each month.  A pair of thick gray wool ones is tip-top - stand much rough wear - & last twice as long as others - before they stand up & talk. Of course if we go back to Egypt or to England don’t send.  
This life is very rough on clothes but I’m pretty careful & look after mine.  I would not be ashamed to go on parade in my uniform at present.  My boots are tip-top - as Scott got them re-soled just before I left, S.A.  An Unley bootmaker did the job, & he did it well too. Those cork & asbestos soles save the inside, and hardly show a sign of wear. I notice there have been some more big moves in your line.  I wonder if I will ever get back to the Dept. - I’m afraid I will not be able to serve under the Methodists & their parasites - Certainly the Military Staff is the very quintessence of red tape - but one has a certain amount of authority which cannot be overstepped even by Kitchener.  I mean to keep my eyes open for a Staff job - but as everyone else is after the same I may not get one.  If I can find a farmer in the S.E to take me on as a “learning partner I will look him up.  Anyhow life in the Dept. will be a misery - especially when competing with cold footers like Halse - & others of my year.  Of course the more of us who volunteer - the less competition for them - so Williams & Co are glad to see us go.  W. is an only son - no-one dependent on him - yet he remains. Dickenson, on the other hand, has his only brother here & a mother & three sisters at home. 
My boys 5/10 have not arrived yet, & I hear are being very badly treated.  They went in a body to Camp H.Q in Cairo, & asked to be allowed to join their officers. This was taken as a breach of discipline - but I can imagine what the poor beggars must feel: being drilled by incompetent English & Ceylon officers - with no-one to take the least interest in them. I spoke to the Colonel about them - but he can do nothing - Brigade H.Q. say “they will be brought up in time to reinforce us when we advance.”  We could do with them here even now, - they are well trained Spens' inspection & remarks proved that, and as for disc. & conduct - when they were with me - one could wish for none better. I reckon one could go right through the British Army an equally disciplined & better conducted set of men. I heard Tom Abbott is crippled with fever at Helio. - he was Mid Wt. Boxing Champion on his troop-ship. Jack Gordon is likely to be 2/Lt. in machine gun co., Have been nearly a month here & only 10 weeks since I left Australia  Munro wrote to me on Ap 7. & it has followed me on from Morphetville.  Are any more Houghton mates volunteering?  Things look bad in England - air raids &c - Any letters lately?
