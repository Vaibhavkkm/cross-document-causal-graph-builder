9th Light Horse Regiment,  Anzac,  November 22nd 1915  My dear mother,  No mail has reached me since last week except one of the parcels sent from Egypt containing chicken broth (which I had ordered) I fear that we will miss a mail as we have been informed that a  large number of mail bags were lost in a boat which was sunk  by a submarine - very bad luck for us. Since writing you the  weather has become bitterly cold & we have been glad to put  on warmer attire one item of which is sheepskin jackets made  from the whole hide of a sheep & which were a present to  the regiment & they do look funny with the hide worn outside &  the fur inside & fashioned as a jacket for the upper part  of the body. It is too unpleasant sitting round at night in  the cold so we retire to our dugouts & I get into bed, which  consists of a stretcher with a soft mattress from my sleeping  bag on top of it & on this I have two blankets sewn together  so as to form a bag & I slip into this put another blanket  or two on top & then in order to read & keep my upper  body warm put on my cardigan & sheepskin & I'm  as snug as a bug in a rug. I have managed to   obtain a lamp now so am quite well able to read.  I am still in my old dug out with the New Zealander  also as he has been unable to obtain anything to cover  his place with, when I remove my tarpaulin to my  new dressing station so I am remaining here until he gets what he wants as we could hardly  go & leave him without a roof to his head. It is a bit crowded but we manage & when  we go to bed about seven at night we talk & so  pass time in addition to reading & my batman  brings in some cocoa about nine o'clock so that after  all, even under these circumstances life is not so bad. A Medical  Association has been formed at Anzac which meets  every fortnight at No 1 Casualty Clearing Station &  Addison (the New Zealander) & l went along & Wesley  stayed at home as it was his turn to do so, because  it is necessary for one man always to be at hand  There was a very large attendance in the big tent  which was used for the meeting, fully fifty medicos  being present. I met fellows whom l had not seen  previously for twelve months & quite enjoyed doing  so & then we had a discussion on an Epidemic of  Jaundice which is prevalent just now, fortunately  only a mild thing, the men being off color in  more ways than one for a few days. Last night a   Turk prisoner gave himself up in our trenches  a fine built fellow, by race an Armenian who had  been forced to serve. He was rather a fine built  fellow with aquiline features & a large nose  & rather fair skinned. He was dressed in  the 8 usual Turkish overcoat of greyish  wool which is a very warm & his clothes were  in good condition & his socks very good. 
He appeared well fed also & is believed to  have been a sergeant. The first indication of  his presence was given by his calling out  near our trenches just about dusk, & one of our  fellows, very small in stature too, hearing him replied  & then jumped over the parapet bayonet in hand  & brought him into the trench with great pride. The  Turk had left his cap & rifle behind & was shivering  with cold, so our kindly fellows took him to a fire & warmed  him & gave him a good meal & then he was brought down  blindfolded & under escort to headquarters. Some  kind chap had given him a muffler for his head &  they treated him generally as a kind of pet. Th His   small captor, proud as a game cock, formed part of  his escort & formed an amusing contrast to his   large prisoner. When he was being taken away from  headquarters the way he was addressed by his guard  amused me very much - "Come on Johnny" said the  escort & away he went though he understood no English  Our lads always speak to the Ghurkas by calling them  Johnny & l suppose it was natural for them to address  him thus. The parcel which l received from Egypt  today was one of the missing ones unfortunately not   the chocs. but some soup which we had tonight  We are to have a winter issue of rations commencing on  Dec. 1st including oatmeal, cheeze, pea soup & cocoa  which will be very much appreciated. Oatmeal particularly  we will be glad of as the men all appear to desire that at present rather than any other item of diet. I am Secretary of the Officer's Mess at present & arrange all the meals & duties of the officers' batman in regard to drawing water & wood for the mess & so on. It entails a little extra work but keeps me employed. In addition I help censor letters when I have time. I have been wondering since reading your September letters if my cablegram announcing my departure to Gallipoli arrived after Ern & Alice left   & hope sincerely that it did not just at the time  when you would be fell feeling lonely. Your letters which I hope to receive soon after you had  received the telegram will enlighten me as regards  that. I hope that you are well & am longing now for some more letters & hope that the gap between the change in my addresses will not be too long & hope you continued to write to the old one from whence they were forwarded.  I have received   the 4 Australian letters since my arrival here, two from you, one from Mab, one from Cedric Job, & one or two from Egypt. I am very well & in good spirits & hope you are the same & all the Evans Thomas family. Much love to all the dear ones wish I could drop in & see them all & a special share for mother from Her loving son, Wilf.
