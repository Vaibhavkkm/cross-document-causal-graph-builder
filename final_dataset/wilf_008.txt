5th & 6th Training Battalions  Zeitoun  August 1st, 1915.     My dear mother,  I am writing this before   breakfast on Sunday morning as I  had to rise at six o'clock today in  order to examine any troops before  their departure for the front as a large  number of the reinforcements went  away this morning, almost all  those who came over with us have gone  already. Since I last wrote you I have  still been kept busy but now that almost  our whole camp has gone to the Dardanelles  I shall have a very easy time until more come.  The days are so similar here that it is  hard to distinguish one from the other.  (Dr.) Charley Wesley & I have arranged to meet  today & go somewhere this afternoon  & then to church in Cairo - he is a  Methodist so we will probably go to  his church first & to mine later. The  Presbyterians have quite a nice little  building. We are not sure, what it wil  time it commences & it is not published 
in the papers so we may miss it yet,  though I believe it is at six oclock.  I have had quite an enjoyable week  in many ways as I have been out nearly  every evening as after being out here all  day on the desert with hot sands  & glare one enjoys seeing other objects  in the evening & it is really what we  live for in Egypt - driving round in a  "garry" (two horsed vehicle) in the cool  of the evening. I do not mean to say  that it is so exceptionally hot for I have  felt it just as hot in Australia on many  occasions but the heat & glare is  continuous whereas it is only in spasms  in Australia. Since I have been here there  appears to have been hardly 10o degrees  of variation in the temperature. It commences   earlier in the morning too I think but it  is not half as hot as I expected it to be.  Most people rest between eleven & four  oclock & go out in the evening - a very  sensible idea & most of the shops shut  between eleven & three oclock. It is a   frightfully expensive place to live in for  a European although some things are  surprisingly cheap. All foodstuffs
such as we eat are very expensive & drinks  are awful. At Shepheards Hotel or the  Continental where one is expected to  go, or visiting the city as all officers  go there it costs 1/- or 1/3 for a soft  drink or hard drink as the case  might be, so that will give you some  idea & if one goes to town he always  gets thirsty & must have something to  drink. On the other hand I bought  a new uniform, made for me by an Indian  tailor near here for 25/- of course not  lined like my other one or of such good  stuff, but good serviceable washing  material, fits well & looks decent.  Then one can get a garry with two  horses to drive you for an hour & a  half or two hours for 20 piastres or 2/-  I have not yet been able to buy any things to send  home or to the branches of the family as it is necessary  to get to know the value of things first, as  in the bazaar where one buys things the natives  always ask four times the value of the article   I have been seeking Oakes since my arrival  & strangely the enough, the first man I mentioned  it to here in our mess had been an officer  in his regiment & told me that he knew 
that Oakes had applied for a position as  sergeant in charge of some clerks & he  thought that he had a good chance of  getting it but was not sure. I then learnt  later that he had got it & was in Cairo  somewhere & I tried to hunt him up yesterday  but being Saturday could not lay my  hands on him, but I'm sure I'll find him soon.  I have received no letters from Australia yet but   am looking for some soon - they often be in  the postoffices I believe for a few days. I wish  you would keep these old letters of mine, my  dear, as they will serve as a kind of diary,  for although I commenced one I have grown  lazy & discontinued it. I went one afternoon  with two other fellows from here - young Ceylon  tea planters - out to the Barage which I think  occurred since my last letter. The Barage is a  large dam on the Nile constructed by British  enterprise which will keep the level of the  water at the necessary height, which can  be altered as the dam has moveable gates  which can be slid upwards or downwards.  Before this was constructed the Egyptians  relied on the annual outflowing of the  Nile to do their irrigation for them & if  the Nile fell below a certain level 
they did not get any water or crops at all. By  constructing the dam however the water  can be kept at a high enough level  to overflow into the canals leading all  over the flat country around which is thus  not only irrigated every year but all the year  round & they produce I believe 4 crops of  certain substances. You realize how flat  the country is when keeping the water dammed  back & raising it's level by a few feet will  cause it to irrigate all the land. We went  to Cairo by rail electric car & then took the train to the Barage   about 40 minutes trip - beastly hot it was  travelling too & were then taken from the  train by trolly's pushed by two natives  on narrow lines to the Barage about   1½ miles away. We passed through a  dirty miserable native village & then on  to beautiful gardens around the Nile.  After being on the desert the sight of  acres of gardens green as Killarney  with thick couch grass everywhere  shrubs & flowers was delightful.  We first passed over one small harch  of the Nile & then over the main dam   which also serves as a bridge &   is moveable at one end to allow the 
sailing boats or felucas, of which there  are a great number, to pass through  & at this part they have gates so  as to form a lock. As soon as we alighted  from our trolly we were seized by a fellow  who wanted to bring us English tea & foolishly  we consented for after waiting some time he  brought four cups a teapot which contained  enough wretched tea to half fill the cups,   & two biscuits each, some dirty looking  milk & forgot the sugar. He wanted  16 piastres (3/4) for it but did not get it.  While eating our tea we were constantly worried by  people wanting to perform for us - a man with  a guinea pig & a pack of cards worried us first  till we threw a glass at him, then a dancing lady  & her husband whom we had difficulty in passing  off, then I noticed a man with a monkey  sidling along & he had to be forcibly ejected.  We then returned to Cairo & the other lads wanted  to go to Shepherds for dinner & I had to  join them - it is very good but abominably  expensive. I had some sole, mixed grill  lemonade coffee & cigar for 6/-. Everything  is served well & is very good but one can't  do it too frequently. We then toddled off  home. Dinner at these places never comes 
on until 8 o'clock & lasts a long time  One other night, Wesley, Flannery & myself  went into Cairo in the afternoon had  light tea there & I walked round the city  for a while, then engaged a garry &  went round the gardens called pronounced  "Geeza" I don't know how it's spelt.  They lie just on the outskirts of  Cairo on the Nile & one drives to  them through a very pretty portion   of the city where the Savoy Hotel - now   closed - Italian embassy & a number  of other fine places. We crossed a  bridge on the Nile of which there  are three in this locality & then  drove through miles & miles of  trees & gardens in the moonlight  -  it was gorgeous. We stopped at  a French cafe & had some very nice  coffee & cakes & drove back again.  The Nile is a very wide & deep stream  about here - I suppose 300 - 400  yards across & so very pretty with  the moon shining on it & sailing boats  flitting about. One of the nurses  who came over with us named Bailey  is a friend of Mrs Cook alia nee Sheppard 
whose wedding I attended some months  ago in Sydney you remember & Lieutenant  Cook came to the front & has been  promoted to Captain. Mrs Cook came as a nurse  & is at No TT Aust. Hospital a few miles away.  Nurse Bailey got into communication with her &   Mrs Cook she arranged a motor drive with some friend  who had a car so six of us went for  a drive to the Barage again one  evening - left about six o'clock from   Heliopolis & got to the Barage about  seven. We took eatables down with us &  bought some liquid down there & had quite   a nice little tea. Then we had to drive back   as Mrs Cook was on duty at nine o'clock  & we allowed only just enough time on  the return trip & of course had a puncture  which took 15 minutes to adjust &  so poor Mrs C was late. We went right  back with her to No TT Hospital at.  Gazirah about 1 mile on the other side  of Cairo & then drove round Cairo had  a look at the Sultan's palace which  is a tremendous bare building built  right on the street & got back to  Heliopolis about 11 o'clock bought  some supper & came home. I forgot  
to mention that Flannery was with us then. He is a  Lieutenant & has just gone to the Dardanelles today. He  came on the Karoola with us & I too came to like him  immensely & he was stationed at this camp with me.  He was just finishing up his law course when he left & had  splendid opportunities which he gave up to come away. There  seems to be some kind of bond between men who have gone  to the same University & Charly Wesley, he & I soon became very  friendly & we have gone out a lot together since our arrival  here & when he suddenly received word to go to the front  after being here only a fortnight I was hugely disappointed  He was an admirable chap in every way. We went to see him  off yesterday afternoon Wesley & myself - drove in by car  & picked up our commanding officer Major Norris on the  way -&- he is also a Sydney barrister, went to tea at the  Continental with him & Flannery had just time to rush  off & catch his train. Wesley & I came back here &  went out for a ride. Lunch bell has now gone as I  have written in too stages so must close & post this  when I go to Heliopolis this afternoon.  I hope you are in good health & cheerful  my dear & that each & all of the family  whose eyes may fall on Wilf's old scribbly  hand are as well as he is himself.  with best wishes & love to all with a  double share to ma mēre   from  Her loving son,  Wilf.
