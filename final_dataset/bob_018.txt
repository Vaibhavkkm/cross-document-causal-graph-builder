Moascar 23 -1 -1916 My dear Mum Am again at work once more was in the hospital six days. legs are OK again applications of hot foments and resting in bed the sores soon healed. Had a very good rest and it was very nice to get several hot baths and have a nice bed. We have again moved to this place which is about 2 miles from Ismailia still in the desert only about 50 times worse than our previous camp we get very little food and what is worse cannot buy anything here however suppose we shall leave here sooner or later. Have just come in  from Church parade but only a farce being unable to hear a word spoken. So put in the time watching a plane flying above us. Received some letters and papers a few days ago which were very welcome. The mails seem to be coming regularly now. Nana has been  away in Cairo for a week  now. he is not yet back. Went away with L/T Barton in connection with comforts & kit bags I believe it will be no doubt  a great trip for him and a  nice holiday expect when he comes back will write and  let you know all about it.  Bye the bye Biddy Barton is now a Captain Leslie a first Lieut. and Sgt Murray has received his commission. Last Saturday afternoon several of us went into Ismailia we all hired bikes and went for a good ride around the canal which was very pretty and interesting I had a  puncture and had to carry a spanner to tighten up nuts etc on the machine every mile or so but that was neither here nor there provoking one to use bad language only. In the evening we went to the pictures and  notwithstanding the our French translation, being rotten they were very enjoyable. No more news at present lots of love to all Bob
