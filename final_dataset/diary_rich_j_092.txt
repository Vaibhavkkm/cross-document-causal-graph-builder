Saturday  26th I went on picket this morning at 3.30 until 6. I rather enjoyed it, regardless of the cold, and the stars were very entertaining and looked so pale and helpless at as the Sun rose and out shone. them We have our own kits packed ^  delivered to be forwarded but find the Colonne has orders from headquarters to stand by and not go aboard to-day
This is extremely disappointing as we have prepared for leaving to-day or early to-morrow morning. I missed my appointment with W L.B badly to-night, and went back to camp at 8 p.m. feeling annoyed.
