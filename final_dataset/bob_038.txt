France. 25.6.1916. Dear Mick Received your letter dated 28.4.16 also one from Mum dated 30.4.16. late last night having just returned from the front line of trenches where I have been with my platoon for the last 3 days & nights for instructional purposes & gradually getting the lads used to being under fire etc before taking over from the battalion which are at present in the line It is quite a good idea we go up in small parties at a time for 72 hrs then come down again and make way for others of the battalion in this way everybody will get a fair idea of things then in a couple of days time we expect to go up and pit take over when the present people there will come back for a rest. I cannot tell you where we are or names of battalions etc the people we relieve are a Sydney crowd met plenty of officers I know which was very nice & from where we are fighting one can get across to London in a day from here. Two of our poor fellows got rather badly wounded yesterday afternoon just before we left it is not too bad in the line I am not a bit frightened of their rifle fire but the shells they send across are simply bloody one has simply no chance unless you are lucky to dodge them the shell fire on the peninsular was a mere baby to it we had a bombardment every night while I was there often when we finish the Hun starts and sends about 3 across to every one we sent it is simply awful you could form no idea what these high explosive shells are like and the man who tells me he is not frightened of them is a liar. Of course you get mla no sleep or very little while in the trenches standing to etc for gas alarms & all the rest of it however expect that is what we came away for. While taking my platoon up along the road the Huns shelled us that while about 3 miles from the line without hitting any one luckily so we got a dose quite early. then yesterday afternoon I wish you could have seen me I went back to a support trench along a sap about 300 yds from the firing line reached there all right but returning they started to shell & inside a minute a dozen or so came across more or less all around me I was first like a rabbit dodging here & there into one bay and then duck etc it was the funniest thing in the world however was damned glad when they stopped and going along & picking up nuggets of shrapnel in the sap you are going along is no good I can assure you. At night we go out in small parties on to No Mans Land that is the ground between the two trenches run into the Hun patrol parties etc so you see there is plenty of excitement I personally fail to see how the devil a chap is going to pull through this lot but of course you never know your luck and take quite a philosophic view of the whole thing which I expect is just as well. You must have had a great motor trip it is indeed a fine way of putting in  a holiday but Mick old cock this is an ideal country it is simply bosca the roads of course are excellent I should simply love a motor tour in this country We had a great trip from Marseilles right up to the N north of France which took about 60 hrs but of think I told Mum about it in my last letter home. Have also received nice long letters from Hope Davis from England we are having a great flirt in our correspondences am first going to write to her now hope to get across to London sooner or later on leave where believe me I intend to have some time the next officer who goes across from here I shall get him to cable to Father from there asking him to send fifty pounds across to the Commonwealth Bank London so that if broke I shall have some cash in London to go on with the leave gives one about 6 clear days in London England so that a fellow could have a good look around in that time Well old chap I could ramble on for about a month writing all sorts of rubbish but I have several other letters to write also some sleep to make up last night being the first decent rest for 4 nights I have had. Nana is kicking around in this country somewhere not far away from us but have not seen him since landing in France however seen one of the officers from his battalion last Monday at a bombing school where I was for the day he told me he is OK and now a full corporal out in orders etc so the kid is getting on all right Remember me to all the boys and lots of love to all at home sorry Father has not been too good this damned war infects all things shall be very glad to get home again but do not see how it can come about for a hell of a long time if at all Mick make all sorts of good excuses for me for not writing to the lads & lasses too often but we are always very busy censoring the lads letters etc in our spare time & I always make a point of putting them through for them as soon as possible. Cheers. Oh & be good - from Bob
