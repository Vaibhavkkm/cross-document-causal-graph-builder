26.9.1916  My dear mother,  Two letters from you arrived last  night with mail up to Aug. 11th. Mail for Australia  closes I believe today so I am just scrawling a  few lines to let you know I received them. I sent  letters previously by this mail but will just add a  little. Am just riding about 6 miles to dentist as  I think one of my teeth needs attention. Everything  very dull & quiet here - very little to do & everybody is  stale. So sorry to hear that Alice is unwell - if  anything requires attention, let her see the best  people not the Newcastle one only, but I sincerely  hope she will be better now. Very sad about Leah's  husband wasn't it? Everybody certainly seems to have  trouble nowadays. I agree with you that it does  seem a never-ending business  - this being away - but  let us hope that the war will end before very long. I  am wanting to see you just as much as you want  me but prospects at present don't seem very bright  unless I could get really sick & I don't think  that seems probable at present - as I am   fattening up again. I am very worried  about you though & do hope that the next  mail will bring better intelligence as to
the state of your health. Do keep in  touch with Dr Rennie if you are not   well & let him know how you progress  & please let me know truthfully how you  are. I do wish I could come along &  help you at present but that is out   of the question I fear.  Take care of  yourself & your diet & don't do too  much & try not to worry & all will  be well & we will yet have that little  jaunt to England together as soon as  the war is over.  Best of love from  Your loving son,  Wilf
