Dear Father & Mother,                                                                                                                    
We have had another shift since
I last wrote, a little nearer the Front and we are
[[?]] at [[?-----nts]] at present - [[?catching?]] all the spare
that the enemy tosses over at our Artillery . I don't
think Fritz has any special malice against infantry
 in [[?]] near Artillery pits - but I am certain he
has a down on Artillery - so we get much of what
was meant for their people.
 
It is a horrible sensation to see
tiles flying off one's roof - I've endured that - but
others have been less fortunate. [[?I've]] [[?seen]] the [[?]]
[[?]] shifted by one shell. Fritz is very busy on the
[[?]] [[?]] - but [[Jack?]] took the [[?]] as far as
effective work went - Beachy Bill alone gave me
over [[our?]] casualties on Anzac Beach - Fritz [[?]]
[[?]] gave to compare with that.
 
Major Herbert [[?& I ]] are together [[?]]
[[?]] H.Q, in the same [[?billet]], [[?]] [[?]] [[?]]
spread out  [[?garrisoning]] various places - [[?]] [[?]]
pretty long days we have walking[[?]] visiting
out details.  Herbert is one of the [[?best]], an [[?]]
[[?]] [[?]] be [[?]] if the [[?]] had [[?]] [[?]] [[line?]]
 
I [[?am]] [[?exhausted]] a lot of the [[?time]] [[?]] [[?]]
[[?]] [[?]] pleased to see me, congratulated me, [[?]] [[?]]
