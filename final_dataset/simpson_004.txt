since I left were to you and Annie  for I have not even answered Sarah's  letters and for all the love that I  have for Peggy it would not be  worth the trouble of wasting good  writing paper over I wrote a couple  of letters to her when I was on  the Heighington and that was the  only letters that I ever wrote in my  life to Peggy. and the only ones   that I am ever likely to write to her  If you had taken my advice in the   first place when I left and kept  her out of it you would not have had  her to worry you at all you should  know Peggy by now Now Mother hopeing  that this will find you and Annie  in the best of health as it leaves  me at present  I remain  Your Loving Son  Jack  P.S. I am enclosing a P.O. for 3 quid  P.S.S If there is any trouble with  P.O. Exchange with Mrs Jackson  Jackson Made Mistake with  Money Order
