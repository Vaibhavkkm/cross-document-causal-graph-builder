Nationality: Australian  I swapped Hippo for a lighter and better beast - & now have a fine big black mare - a real beauty, & in tip top condition. Herbert and I are getting leave to have a ride round in a day or two - as my batman (White) reckons she's getting too frisky - no work since Egypt. The Russians seem to be going strong, & the French are doing pretty well in the Somme - but so far the Tommies have not done what was expected (Big Push).  Later on the Canadians, & S Africans, & Anzacs will have their turn, & I guess something will shift there.  You will have read about IT in the papers, long before this reaches you. I will close now - much love & good wishes from Rollo.
