March 30, 1918 – Ordered to 54th Casualty Clearing Station for temporary duty. It [the CCS] was also moving. Finally located at Haverskerque out in a new plowed field and in tents. Has been raining since noon continually. Muddiest place I have ever seen. C.O. Col. Franco seems very nice. Very little doing at present. Very heavy and continuous firing nearby. Old tent leaking in several places.
