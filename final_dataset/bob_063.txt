 My dear Mum,
Had a great Xmas spent the most of the day in the hospital had a splendid dinner turkey plum pudding fruit sweets champagne whisky port etc in the evening took two girls out to dinner and on the whole had a very bright time Am at present staying at the above address with Mrs. Purvis - Russell - Montgomery This place is about 25 miles north of Edinburgh and truly a delightful spot. Shall send a couple of views of the house it is indeed a mansion the grounds also are beautiful 2 tennis courts a billiard table 3 motor cars 4 horses for riding They also have their game keeper special pond for wild duck etc etc so you can easily see the sort of time I am having. 
Am here with Major Marks and Capt Howden (45th Battn who are across on leave This is the place that Col. Tllney said any of the 13th officers had a free invitation so we are taking advantage of it Left London last Thursday night shall probably leave here New Year morning for Edinburgh spend a couple of days there and then back to London
I have to be back at hospital on Wednesday. May come back here later it is a gorgeous spot plenty of sport good food dress for dinner every night 5 or 6 courses etc servants glaco galore of course people with tons of money First night I got into bed here I thought it was apple-pied but bless you no it was a hot water bottle I did not know what to do with the thing at first but eventually decided so dragged it out and put it under the bed. Shall write at length later love, Boby.
