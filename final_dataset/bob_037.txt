France 18.6.1916. My dear Mum We have again moved since landing in France now being very close to the front line not more than 3 miles so that being in support we will be having a go at the Germans any time now. We had a ten mile march from our last billets to these which of course was a little strenuous but most interesting and of course very pretty we all feel the hard metal roads which make ones feet very sore after the soft sand of Egypt. however suppose we will get used to them shortly. Marching here we came through in artillery formation so took no risks of the battalion being wiped out by shell fire several houses etc in this town have huge holes and are generally knocked about by the enemys shells I also witnessed a house burning caused by a shell this afternoon about 600 yds from here so you see we are a bit too close now to feel absolutely safe. One never goes out without his gas helmet it is rotten stuff we all went through some to test our helmets & get a general idea of it we have glasses also to wear to protect the eyes against some other stuff they use and on the whole am not too keen on it at all. Before leaving our last billets A Coy officers invited the Colonel, Adjutant, Doctor of the battalion to dinner We had a great time the band to play a 6 course dinner with plenty of wine (Champagne) to drink They are great wine drinkers in this country champagne being considerably cheaper than whisky to buy. I shall send you home the menu card written in French & printed by us all the united work of the 6 company officers numbering six we had all sorts of fun over this little dinner as you could imagine Madame of the house did the cooking, lent us glasses etc etc so that it was quiet a swank affair of course the next day we were back on the ordinary fare bully beef etc although I must admit ones meals are better as an officer than a private still it is all pretty rough now and will be for some time to come Our leave to England has started 1 officer & 3 men going at a time per battalion for 8 days Capt Marks our Adjutant who bye the bye is a clerk in the City Bank left a couple of days ago people who were on the peninsular longest are going first but expect my turn will come along all right shortly next one who goes across. I shall get them to send a cable for me to Father from London asking him to send me fifty pounds to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in London then when I get over there I shall not be short of ouh  cash also expect Nana will need some he did not move up here our brigade of the division only moving so far have not seen Nana since landing in France but believe he is OK his battalion arrived safely and were billeted not far from us in our last place Had a long letter from Hope Davies yesterday also a postcard this letter was dated 12th June London it is great getting letters so quickly we are not used to that I intend to look her up if lucky enough to get over there having been promised a great time re tennis etc etc she is some hard nut by her letters it is great fun writing to people you do not know both saying all sorts of small things she sent me a bosca photo of herself and wanted one of myself I told her is she saw my photo she would not like me half as much as she did so would not send one along yet a while in fact I have not got one but intend to have some when I get an opportunity of having it taken however and looking forward greatly to seeing this little lass for she looks some class. Am going away all day tomorrow to a bombing school which as far as I know at present only lasts one day so after this shall probably be reserve bombing officer for the battalion We expect to be here about a week then go into the trenches for a week and so on however do not yet how they work things all being well shall have been in action here no doubt by the time I write again lots of love to all, Bob.  Robert J.

You may think it queer signing our full name at the bottom of each letter but censoring is very strict in this country so that one cannot say very much then if you do they know who to blame etc for same each mans letter has to be sign signed by an officer at the end & also on the envelope his full name so that one is kept very busy censoring letters which takes most of ones spare time. We have not received any Australian mail. RJH in this country yet
