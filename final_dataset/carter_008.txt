Mena Camp  19/2/15  We have had 5 days bivouac towards  Sakkara. First day we marched from camp  to the site arriving at midday. After a 4 hour  spell we went out to take up a defensive position  & dug trenches all night. I had a bit of rest from  9 pm to midnight - managed to sleep about an hour -  but there were too many stones to be comfortable.  Next day was spent in defending the trenches against  the 4th Bat. Sunday night we marched out at  9 pm & marched the whole night - we don't go  faster than 2 miles an hour - After a few hours you  get into a mechanical walk. & some men seemed  also to go asleep while marching - at the halts  everyone would immediately flop where they stood & in  a few seconds you would hear snores 
at 4.30 am. Monday - fixed bayonets & charged  a hill & after rest & breakfast we carried on  the attack till midday - next day we  marched back to camp. after an address by the Brigadier  in which he declared us 'fit for war'
