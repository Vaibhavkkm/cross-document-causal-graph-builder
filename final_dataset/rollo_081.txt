any decoration as long as my boys finish up O.K.  I heard from Boltons 3 days ago, - they seem to  think their Tommies are doing all the work - the  biggest mistake out as 3 divisions of Tommies failed  at what our Division did at first try!!  I have only war news to send - so must wind up  Anyhow I'll go into action with the calm assurance  that I have done my duty to my men & to my country  If I happen to fall, - rest content with the  knowledge that I have played the game, and done  my job thoroughly, which is more than some folk in  'khaki' can conscientiously affirm  I am hopeful of getting through O.K, but you will  know long before you get this, - if you've heard  nothing - well "no news will be good news" & I'm O.K.  Don't worry if letters are few & irregular during the  next few weeks - will probably be very busy.  Best of all good wishes to you all, long lives,  happiness, success, good health, & prosperity to you  all - very much love from your loving son  Rollo  N.B. The above particulars are for home use only  I've taken pity on your lack of real news in  Australia - but keep mum.
