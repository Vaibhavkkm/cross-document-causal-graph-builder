11th June 1917.
My dear Birdwood. Many thanks for your letter of the 7th June and most interesting  report on operations by the Anzac Corps which you send me to see. I have read them with the greatest pleasure. It is a record of hard hammering fighting such as the Australians have had so much of right through. It is wonderful how they come up again, time after time, fresh and ready to begin it all once more. This I am sure is mainly due to your influence and leadership - they would not have been able to do it without that. I hope you will have a good time when you do come home and as good weather as you are having now,and that I may see you as you pass through town one may or the other. We are very pleased at my boy having got the Military Cross for organizing and commanding a successful raid in his battalion. He has now gone to Italy as a Staff Captain and will be there for some months I gather. All well here. Your’s ever,
HV. Cox.
