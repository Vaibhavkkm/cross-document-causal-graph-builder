Saturday. October 3rd No leave Full dress parade this morning. Each man came out with his kit which were examined; many little things were missing and fellows had other men's things ^goods in there kits. We dismissed after a little drill In the afternoon all hands fulled robed for marching orders including great coat, folded up. set out for South Head, it was very pleasant walking down over Belvue  Hill but the return through bush and over sand hills was hard & hot work. I applied to the Colonel for leave to spend to-morrow at Narrabeen He refused, but I was very determined to go and felt the restriction very severely.  The Manly Phonegraph was in use, so George Hill & I played chess until 10 p.m.  I got beaten and "Lights out."
