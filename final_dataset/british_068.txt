… I must thank you for the cigarettes you sent me, I received them with your letter last night, and I was just on bankruptcy as regards fags, so you can consider you have saved my life. So you are going to have a (pigeon) kill off to reduce numbers, well, they’ll come in handy for the homing pigeon fund, that is if you don’t want them for yourselves. Dad has had my place lime-washed out, he says it looks quite smart again. I think there are only four old birds and two youngsters there now.
The bombs from the Zeps (Zeppelins) shook you up then, they make a nice little row don’t they. I have heard them out here and seen them drop, and a piece of one of the bombs hit me and I was quite 500 yards from where it dropped, of course it did not hurt me, as it was spent. Even the noise from those bombs is not a quarter as loud as one I had drop near me last Saturday, it was a trench mortar bomb and although I was quite 50 yards from it the force of the explosion knocked me over.
Yours very sincerely
Ron
