Dear Mother  Just a line to let you know that I received your welcome letter the other day I am glad to hear that you and Annie are keeping well for I am keeping in the best of health I am sorry to tell you that we are still in camp at Mena I am beginning to think that we are here for good for I dont think there is any signs of us leaving for a long while yet There has been some fighting here in Egypt with the Turks there has been about six hundred prisoners come into Cairo this week from the canal There was two Battalions went down to the canal from our contingent last week but I have not heard
whether they got down to the canal in time to have a hand in the [[scre?]] last week Now Mother I told you last week that my officer had sent a [[f?]] to Sir George Ried to see about [[yo?]] my money paid over to you [[?]] I have wrote to the Manager of th Commonwealth Bank in London today so that you might be able to draw the money all the quicker For at the rate of two Shilling per day by the time you get this letter you should have about twelve pound due to you so when you get this letter write straightaway to the Manager of the commonwealth  Bank in London and if nessersary show him this letter and I think that you should be able to draw the money all right Now Mother I hope that this will find you and Annie in the best of health and with love to you and Annie I remain your Loving Son,  Jack
