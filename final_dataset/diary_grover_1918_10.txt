Notes:

1 The Marigny Theater in still in operation today. It has a website at www.theatremarigny.fr.
2 I think he is referring to the performance at the theater. Here Ends The Diary of Grover Carter

“Died 10-16-1918” is written in what appears to be Clara Mai Prather’s handwriting.
Parvin Carter places Grover’s death at “near Bapaume” in a letter to Mr. C. L. Major,
Ramer, Tennessee, dated Dec. 5, 1923. Quoting from the letter “Was killed in action
while on duty night of October 16th, 1918 near Bapaume France due to high explosive
shrapnel.” However, the last position mentioned by Grover was at Le Cateau which is
east of Bapaume. Grover was buried in the American Cemetery, Flanders Field. In 1924
his body was returned to the Oak Hill Cemetery, Selmer for reburial in the Carter family
plot.
