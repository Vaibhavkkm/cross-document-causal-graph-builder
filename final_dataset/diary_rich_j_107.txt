 March 15th. "Reconnaissance." Subject prepared for after dinner lecture by officers:-- Aeroplanes play such a valuable part in reconnaissance work at the present time that patrole or scouts parties have not the same scope, or is their so much need for their endeavours, with air photography developed to so remarkable and reliable point. Nevertheless, there is yet a whole lot of personal work that company or - 19 - battalion scouts will be required to do, more especially with the possibility of semi-open warfare. Infantry scouts work on foot and usually operate near the force to which they belong. The value of the work done depends largely upon the orders they receive; a specially defined objective must be given them, and it will be impressed upon the scout leader the actual questions he will be expected to answer upon his return. Scouting parties will avoid combat with the enemy as far as possible but they must be prepared to fight at any moment. They should be sound physically and in good condition. Be able to form sound conclusions from signs, such as clouds of dust footprints etc. Understand the various forms of signalling and give in consise reports as well as sketches showing full detail.
