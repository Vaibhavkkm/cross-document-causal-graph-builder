 31st October 1915   My dear Father,  I haven't had  a letter from you just lately,  but I hope you are quite  well, I so look forward to  your letters delivered back  at the Old Peninsula  again after two months  holiday, I feel a different  man to what I did when  I left it, I never felt so  run down in all my life  as I did then.  I hear you have been
 having a few Zepplin  attacks on London just  lately; I wonder our aircraft   can't cope with them  a little better.  We have had some rather  cold windy weather just  lately, I am not looking  forward to the long night  watches during winter too  much, but I suppose it  will have to be done.  I hope you have heard  from Kenneth by now,  he has not written to  me yet, but the last   letter I had from Aunty  Mary, said that he  was on a hospital boat,  off Egypt so that he  might have gone to Egypt,  Malta, or England, for all  I know; I hope it is  to England, & then he  can take a good long  spell, & get some furlough  off, to come & see you  all.  I wish I could get hold  of some interesting news  to tell you, but everything  is practically the same day after day.  There is pretty heavy  bombardment going on  night & day here, with  the big guns.  Give my love to  Mother & Margery, when  you see them next.  Your affectionate Son,  Guy Arnold.
