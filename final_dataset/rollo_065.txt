 Dear Father & Mother - It is nearly a fortnight since I last wrote, but owing to all mails out or in being stopped indefinitely, it has perhaps been hardly worth writing, even if circumstances had allowed us time to write letters. Just a fortnight ago today our battn was started off in the new campaign, and as a unit was pulled out of the front line.  I finished up on the extreme right near C Township & had a front of nearly 4 miles.  Poor old Hippo broke it with the extra work he had to do then, & a remount was sent to me, & fine big upstanding dark bay mare - full of pace & life, so I've decided to stick to her. About a week ago we were relieved, my boys had to march about 13 miles to the Battn residences, & these are quite a few miles from the Canal.  Next day we went for a 10 mile march on the road to get their feet steady, & then next day we packed up & proceeded to entrain.  We bivouaced at the station that night & left early next morning for Alex, one of the longest troop train journeys I have ever done, & we embarked later the same day.  Next morning early we pushed out & have now been out 2 days. The boys were nearly flagged out for during the past 3 weeks they had had an extremely rough time, and many of them nearly broke down.  I am very glad to see.
