 Sunday Dearest Mother Just another line to let you know that we have arrived at [[?]] another stage of our journey We have had a delightful time & very calm weather & we are all in the very best of health (& a plentiful supply of clean clothes.) We have all been vaccinated and innoculated against Tho  Typhoid & Cholera so we are very fit now. Our people settled the Emden alright They sent the Sydney out in response to the distress signal S.O.S. which we all received & she rounded her up after 20 minutes sailing at full speed & chased her towards us, & then we sent the Japanese to meet her. My word Mum, it was a sight, she cleared for Action in about 2 minutes & stoked up that much, that flames were coming out of her funnels, & the next thing they were fighting for all they were worth & the old Emden ran ashore after all her funnels were shot off. Then the Collier was the next to go, & after taking off her crew, they blew her to bits & she went to the bottom. All this you know I expect, & I suppose  "I hope you are all well" Tell Rupert. the Cingalese, have funny little boats, & they can swim like fish, their boats are called Catamorans

there were great rejoicings in Melbourne on the news being received. We have lost several horses on the voyage, but all the rest are well. We have Concerts twice a week, & Church parade on Sunday. We have no difficulty in getting our clothes washed on board & at a reasonable price. I have only been sick a couple of days since leaving our last Port, but innoculation shakes a man up. We have a man on board who is malingering & the Dr has had him put in Cells & every morning is forced up to the showers & held under for a quarter of an hour then made to work at scrubbing decks. The New Zealanders who are with us, have gone on ahead to [[Boal?]], & if we land, I will try & meet Les [[?]], my old mate Trumpeter who is with them. How is every body? I only wish I could write to them all but we are only allowed to write 1 letter, and you come first easy, so please let all enquiring friends, why it is I don't write. I must now close with best Love to everybody at home & else where & accept same for yourself from your Loving & Happy Son Norman  Tell George that there is hardly a wrist watch on board that is not broken & mine is broken also, so I'll get another when in England We are not allowed to say much as all letters are censored Norman.

Write to Constable D Watson Royal Mint Melbourne & tell him what I have told you & that I am not allowed to write more than one letter

3rd letter
