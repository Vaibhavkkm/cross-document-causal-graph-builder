Renmark Tuesday Darling. I was quite excited getting all your letters. Two at Kingston and one here The only ones I have received since I have been away. I caught a boat at Waikerie Kingston on Friday Sat. night but it only went as far as Loxton so I had to wait there Sunday. It was a perfect night Sunday st awfully still and a cloudless sky. I went for a walk with Morrie Claxton from Adelaide & he th must have thought me af very dull a or mad as I was gazing at the stars all the time. I was thinking of you. I was quite sure you were thinking of me too at the time.
The boat was very late getting here so I only got your letter last night I haven't had much luck so far.  I leave here on Wednesday night.  I have to spend two days at Kingston and two at Waikerie so reaching Adelaide by Saturdays train is out of the question If you write this week Waikerie Hotel will be the best to address it to. It is now 1.30 & the mail closes at a quarter to & I haven't had any dinner yet. I will be going all the afternoon and evening and all to-morrow. I am beginning to like these uphill arguments Its like fighting a lost cause a little success now and then keeps you from getting too downhearted but it is much more interesting than if it was all success. With love I remain Yours ever Tom   This is a long one 5 minutes & worth a page of small ones.
