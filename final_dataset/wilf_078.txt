QUIS AQUAM NILI BIBIT AERUM BIBET SHEPHEARD' S HOTEL CAIRO 23.1.1917
My dear mother I am in Cairo on three days leave, & am trotting round rapidly - have hardly had a minute since I came,  as there are a number  of people I wanted to see & a lot of shopping to do for the Ambulance & myself so I am just scribbling a short note to to tell you that all is well & will write a good long  letter when I get back in the dear old desert Your two registered letters arrived before I came up here, with much love from Your loving son, Wilf.
