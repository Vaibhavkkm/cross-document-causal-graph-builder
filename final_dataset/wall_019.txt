T.S.S. NORTHLand. March 17th 1916.  Dear Mum Well we are on our way to France now, I fancy we will land at Marseilles & go on by train. We have had a good trip so far nothing startling has occurred we haven't been submarined yet but we seemed pretty shakey a couple of times. I hope Blanche & Bob & Jack is keeping well and got plenty of work & money. I have have a first class passage we dine with the Officers & all. we dine separate from the Sgts. because I rank as a warrant officer now. & can wear a Sam Browne belt if I choose but I am not fussy you know. I suppose Blanche will be on her way by now & if I have any luck I will go to England to see her. You had better write that address of dad's relations in England & I will look them up well so long for now love to all from Your loving Son,  Wally.
