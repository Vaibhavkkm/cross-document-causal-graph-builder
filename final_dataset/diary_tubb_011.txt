 Got some more letters from Mother and the girls last night dated 11th & 12th of May. Frank & I enjoyed reading them very much. Attended consultations under Major Ledder for purpose of arranging best method of preparing to resist an attack. u in Our Bde can muster 148 rifles for the firing line the 3rd A.S.C. 100 rifles The attack is expected from in between the sea & the salt lake. It is reported that some fanatic with a large following is about 100 miles from us & it is thought probable that his objective is Alexandria. As we are between him & that place it behoves us to be prepared! The accounts of our casualties & engagements seem to be getting home to Australia about a month after they happen. In some particulars the accounts are censored! 
The 5 & 6th Brigades it was that arrived on Wednesday Col Linton as Brigadier they are going to Heliopolis . Report says that they were issued with their rifles only two days before they left. Miss Maire representative of [[?]] [[Brindisie?]] photographers came out by request & photographed our section transports. It took a darn of a long time to group our men to the satisfaction of the photographer! A meeting of all officers took place at the Camp Commandant's resulting in improvements being arranged Helped Lt Eller to compute allowances to units - We each draw 2/3 a month per man from the Contractors (Nile storage Co) for regt funds for the right of canteens stores etc.
