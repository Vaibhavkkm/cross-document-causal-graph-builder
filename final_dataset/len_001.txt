 My Dear little Mollie, I was so glad when you came and spoke to me on the telephone this morning, because then I knew that you were really better. You are such a good, brave little girl - a real soldier- and I am just terribly proud of you. I would drive into Toowoomba to see you, little girl, only if I go to see you I might give you the sickness that Peter had, and I don't want to do that. It wouldn't do at all would it? But I think about you all the time, & I want you to come back here to look after me again, as soon as you can. When you are all right & when Peter is all right, you will both go away to the seaside, & paddle in the water & play in the sand, if you would like to. You ask Dr Falkner to if it would be a good thing for you to have some "surf-bathing" next time you see him. Isn't he a good kind man to look after you so well, & make you better again. Peter is getting along well - he cuts wood for the stove. By & bye you will help him. He has a pretend sulky in the yard & two pretend horses in it. I went for a drive in it yesterday. He calls the two horses “Navy-blue Nedwood" & “Pink Tom”. Don’t you think these  are nice names? Will you give my love to grandma & Aunt Emma. I hope that when you read this you are really quite well.  I got your paintings - they are lovely & they are in my room. Good-bye now, my dear little brave muffet. You will soon be all right & I will see you again. With ever so much love & lots of kisses from Father.
