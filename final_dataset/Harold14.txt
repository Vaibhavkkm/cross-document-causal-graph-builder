Dear Father & Mother,
We have just recd. portion of a mail
letter from Mum while at [[?Inglewood]], [[?am]] glad to know
Harry & Mum had a good time at Houghtons]] but sorry
that Dad wasn't able to be there too
 
No news from here - except we're in
"close support" - less than a mile from the firing line
have met most of my old chums in the [[10th?]] - especially
old Jack Hamilton who on Gallipoli was like a big brother
to me. He is one of the best - Hope he gets through O.K.
not seen [[?---clagan]], Weir, or Giles yet - but hope to soon.
 
Was assured to read S. is on his way
back.- I might have had such a holiday - but the
"Sat. afternooners" are no good at this game - they are
best at Mitcham teaching the boys to "[[f]] fours" What
the d. is [[?Stippe?]] doing - still suffering from "shock" or
is he a "recruiting officer."
 
This will not be a very [[?newsy]] letter -
except that the firing line is really dangerous, & D'.
should be told so before its too late. Fritz uses
shells, bombs, & aerial torpedoes, [[& at ]] [[times]] [[t--cks]]
our trenches [[inside out]] & the occupants rotten - but
fortunately we have artillery too & play the same
game only we send about [[?? their ??]] their front
line must get a hell of a time.
 
The aerial torpedoes are awful things
