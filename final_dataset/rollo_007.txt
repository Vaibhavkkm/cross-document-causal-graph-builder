 As I mentioned in a rough scrawled note -  (?)  we have split & moved - The parent battalion is still  at the old spot & work - while we are here as the  nucleus of the & backbone of the new 50th.  As far as I can see - only my age will keep me   from getting my step - At present I am acting O.C.  of C. Company  - so unless they put four senior “dinkum”  officers on to us - my Captncy. should be a certainty.  You can’t imagine how glad we are to be away   from B.  Don’t forget the new address  50th Battalion  13th Brigade  3rd Division A.I.F.  Egypt  The 50th is the   Fighting Fiftieth  or “Hurcombe’s Hungry Half”  not  the “Dirty Arf Hundred”  Hoping you’re as well & happy as myself - with  best of good wishes, & very much love  Rollo.
