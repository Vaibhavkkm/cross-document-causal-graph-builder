Text:  Dear Father & Mother,-                         Just a short note on the eve of going a little further  forward - to say things are going well - weather is  improving, men are very fit, unit up to strength, and  everyone has got his punch,- tails well up, chins well  out, noses up - etc, etc, in fact we are not only  like Johnny Walker but also Viceroy tea.  Fritz has gone well back but somehow I don't  think they'll go very far - as they are now almost  in the Hindenburg Line.  This Line is a beauty from what we hear - anyhow I  wouldn't mind having a look at it.  Our aeroplane  trip was knocked on the head on account of weather,  however it has been promised to us when next we  come out of the line.  Only last night I received your Plum Pudding.  It was  intact, but the tin was battered out of recognition.  We  got it out without breaking it, managed to boil it, & at  dinner today it was splendid, and everyone was delighted  We didn't find the lucky button, & we will come on it & the  coins in the second half.  Anyhow I am glad it came to  hand -  I had almost posted it as gone.  I went to Albert today - the inhabitants are slowly coming back  last August there were no civilians there - now they are  flocking back.  This must be a very brief note - plenty of  work ahead, no news.  We are 2 days behind the newspapers  so you may guess where we are.  I will write again as soon as possible; & will now close with  Very very much love, & best of all good wishes for all sorts of  good luck & hope you are as well as Your loving son, Rollo.
