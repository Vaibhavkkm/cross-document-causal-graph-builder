8/10/1916,  France,
 Dearest Mother,
  I am sitting down in a little French  Farm trying to find something  to write about.  First of all you  will want know that I  am well & I suppose that  is the main thing with  you. (Getting conceited, aren't I)  We are having  a rest for some little  time & they poor boys need  it badly. The wet, breaks  them up worse than the  shells & trench foot seem the  order of the day.
I have very comfy quarters  here & share a room with  Leuit Kent & am at this moment  writing in the living room  of the farm. with the daughter  opposite me also writing & the loveliest  cup of coffee along side which   it is possible to imagine.  I tell you, its not  a bad sort of old war at  all, when its like this.  I've had a letter from  Molly & she is O.K. so  are the boys.  I am still worrying  them about leave; but cant  get any further.  I expect there will  be an explosion when I 
put in again next week  There seems to be  an impression here generally,  that the Huns will be  likely to collaps before the  end of the year; but that  appears improbable to me.  Its too good to be true.  Besides it is likely that  such a wonderful military  machine, as theirs undoubtedly  is, would break down at  the first really hard knock  it has had? There is not  the slightest doubt that they  are staggered though. & if we  keep hammering they must   collapse utterly sooner or later  I didn't mean to write 
an article on the war  when I started so  I'll knock off.  Give my dear love  to Dad & Jennie.  God bless & keep you  all.  Aurevoir Mother of mine  Heaps of love  Ever your own boy,  Ernie.
