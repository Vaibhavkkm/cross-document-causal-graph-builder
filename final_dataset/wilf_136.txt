CERTUM PETE FINEM THE BLUE FUNNEL LINE S.S. "AENEAS" 1. 2. 1919. My dear mother, We are arriving at Melbourne today. Do not expect to land on account of influenza. We have a little cargo for Melbourne & some troops to disembark so I don't expect we will get away before Monday or reach Sydney before Wednesday. There is such a lot of humbug at disembarkation time that I think it would be better for you not to bother about coming to meet me at the wharf as you will surely be kept waiting and foozling about for hours & will get very tired I don't know the procedure when we land at all - expect we will have to go & report somewhere before we finally get away I'm very fit my dear & hope you are the same & not getting over excited. All news when we meet, with lots of love from Your loving son Wilf.
