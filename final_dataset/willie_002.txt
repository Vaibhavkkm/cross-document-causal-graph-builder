Have left Lemnos, & last night attempted to  land at the arena, the scene of the 'big row', but the weather was too rough, & we had to pospone the landing.  We are now lying in  security, awaiting better conditions, so that we may carry on the disembarkation. I had a good reception from my old comrades when I came back, & quite a number expressed their pleasure at seeing me back again, & in good health. Our Brigade Major was one, & asked very kindly about my wound, if there was any after effect, etc. If you remember, it was upon his office that I was hit.  One man was killed last night aboard here by stray shot. We could see the fire along the beach (where it cannot be seen by Turks) & heard the firing quite plainly as we lay in the cove. I suppose that we shall get ashore tonight - it cannot be done by day, unless by great loss of life, as the turks start shelling as soon as landing parties start work. Shall write again later if possible
with Love, Will. P.S Cannot write to all so please forward news & love to Grandma & all at Home W.A.
