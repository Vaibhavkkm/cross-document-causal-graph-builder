Wednesday   Sept. 30th General leave 5 to 10pm Our new camp contains 9 men the ground is very uneven and makes one very stiff to sleep on. The three buglers are in our tent and everything seems very reasonable A good long walk, carrying stretchers through the pretty Spring folag foliaged Centennial Park was very pleasing. The lake of water lilys were delightful. I went to Manly at night and saw W.B. This girl does attract me, and sometimes evens haunts me, yet when I attempt to reason matters out I cannot see matrimony looming at all. Circumstances of cance prevents me considering the point at present. Camp at 12 o'clock
