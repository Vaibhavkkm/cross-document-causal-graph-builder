Saturday.

 Rose early. (our reveille is 4 am always) put in a busy day shifting our Camp down to new site.  finished up at 5 pm. The new site is much better for our (officers) quarters. We are 8 officers strong now. viz Major Tedder Lt McQuie, Lt Colman. ASC & Capt Whitfield V.O. & Bain, Bollon Eller and self. We have a fine hospital but for mess. The men all worked like ants & our new Camp presents a completed appearance already. No news yet of my going! Capt Robin has left us rejoining his AS.C. The reports of our attack on the peninsula, that have been published  in the Argus's that have been  received here. dated May 2nd & 5th  are causing comment. The paper
 
accounts of our doings are quite misleading & wrong. When Aust learns the real facts they will be much surprised  -
