My Dear Eileen

There will probably be a mail
going out at 4.30pm, the first chance I
have had of dropping you a line since
No 17, pages 53 to 56. The previous letter to that
was one posted in Alexandria Cairo last Sunday
No 16 pages 40-52. No 17 was posted in Alexandria
on March 1st. From page fifty seven I am
writing you a letter which [[I will]] post when the
opportunity offers.
The censorship is to be very strict I believe
so don't be disappointed if with this short note.
We have not had any war news this month 
and are all wondering how things are going 
especially [Censored]
I am in tip top nick & feeling very well so are
all the others you know.
I wrote a letter to mother & Teo but do not know
whether they they will pass or not
I detest this censorship more than you do. There 
seems nothing you can say. I wrote a letter
to you yesterday but had to tear it up as it
had no chance of passing.
I haven't seen Gay for some time but wouldn't
be surprised to run across her in a few weeks
as there is some talk of that lot following 
taken all through we have had a good time the 
last week. What our job will be there is no
knowing. At present it looks like as if we
would still be doing something similar to
the last 3 months. I can't think of anything
more to say, except goodnight 
Yours truly,
Tom
There ought to be another mail within a  week or two.
