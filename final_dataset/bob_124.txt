 Dear old Mick, Will write to you this time for a change wrote a few lines to Mum last night enclosing a few snaps which will interest you all but had a lot of work to do which prevented me from carrying on however shall have another go tonight. First of all what is all this I hear about Nana being wounded again there must be some mistake he is at present in the front line one of our officers was up there to-day & saw him hale & hearty had a yarn to him I was going up tomorrow
myself for a preliminary reconnaisence tomorrow and would have seen him but have to send another officer now as Gen Birtles is coming around & of course OC Company have to be here however hope to get away the next day and shall look him up and shall try & get a cable through to you. fancy the military have must have made another bull. It is quite possible we shall be releiving his brigade in the line & they will come where we are at present  "in out in out on guard" style you know but of course you dont know that expression comes in bayonet fighting. Had quite a good time last 
Sunday after Church parade Bomb Wells Edgar Moseley & self rode into a good sized town not far from here We had an excellent lunch several whiskies & sodas a good bottle of the Vive Clinquot 1906 vintage after which a roam around the town shopping etc. these little outings just about save one's bacon especially this rotten cold weather If lucky enough to get through this next show shall be about due for leave again I could also get 8 days leave to Paris but cannot stand the strain one would need at least £50 for 8 days in Paris & London is very little better so that to do justice to ones self in both places 
in 6 months would be too big a drain on a limited amount of money. Bye the bye Mick would be glad if you will let me know how finances stand have only about £40 in the bank London and may require to get some more across expect I still have a few quid left over in Aussi. Tell Mum the sheet of paper & envelope arrive safely in each letter but we are very seldom short of writing pads so that I seldom use it for writing letters. The couple of snaps Mum sent across are great I think who took them Avis appears to be growing into a fine girl Tell Lorna I received her letter 28th Oct quite all right am not writing to her I know she reads all the ones that go home or should do Cheer Oh for present lots of love to all,  Bob
