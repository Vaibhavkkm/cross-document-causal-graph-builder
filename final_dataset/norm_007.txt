Military song

Tell Jack Tilton that Jack Heywood has grown a beard & looks like & Prehistoric Man (it is on account of a skin complaint Braithwaite has grown a moustache & looks a lad. I am writing this after stuff because I haven't got an envelope Tell Miss Taylor that I am in the best of health & hope she is the same. Tell Mabel that I haven't seen a pretty girl since leaving Melbourne. I haven't had a slice of Toast & will not know the taste of it soon Please don't worry about my not having clean clothes, for I have plenty. Also, I have any amount of money & if you want any, please let me know. I haven't wanted to draw any since coming on the boat, & so I will have about £8 to draw when I do. I still have £2.10 in my belt Tell George that I got his watch fixed up by one of the Chaps on board. I hope his business is a big success by now. Envelopes are worth £-s-d now & it is difficult for a man to get one Don't forget about the bonzer feed when I come back home 

4th December 1914 Later/ we have just arrived at Alexandria & are to dis- embark in the morning & proceed at once to Cairo & there hoist the Union Jack / Have just received a letter from Jack Tilton, but none fr others. Braith got one from Mab Love to all, Norman.
