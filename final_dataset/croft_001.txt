Dear Friend  Just a line to let you know that  I am geting on allright. I am at Mena House  Hospital with a bullet through the left fore  arm. the result of last Sunday's fighting (the 25th.  when we forced a landing against big odds.  It was a great fight while we were getting out of  the boats and a good many got shot, but a  baynot charge soon [[stuffed?]] the Turks and things  got pretty lively. Toward miday 12 noon they were  knocking us over pretty often and I stopped a bullet  in my pocket-book after it had been through my  arm, a good thing for me that it turned against  the bone causing it to come out broad-side on  (as the Doctor says) in which fashon it entered  my pocket-book going almost entirly through  it, had it done so there would have been no  more Turks for me. I thought I was finished as it  was the blow over the heart knocking me out.

I will send you the pocket-book to keep for me  as soon as I go to Cairo, it is no use to me  now, but as it saved my life I would like to  keep it as a curio not that I shall ever want  reminding of my first battle it was too awful  I enjoyed it untill I got shot, then I had to leave  the firing line and make the best of my way back  the Turks peppered us with shrapnel all the way  back to the beach and even while we were being  taken to the Hospital ship. Well I am not  complaining it is what I was looking for and  I got it. We are very well looked after by  the Nurses and Doctors and we will soon be  at them again my arm is nearly haro healed  up but I have lost the use of my hand for a while  IH I hope you are doing well although things  must be very slack in Bulli just now. but a  long way better than this place with its dirty  niggers and flies. Well no more this time  remember me to all   Yours Sincerly  John Croft
