May 14, 1918 – While attending “D” battery sick parade, the Hun dropped a 5.9 in. shell just outside the barn. Killed one man outright. He then began shelling the farm in general. Wounded several Frenchmen who had a battery just about 50 yds. behind us. We left for some nearby trenches and remained there for 2 hrs. while he Germans shelled the place continually. Had a piece [of shell] on my tin lid. Orders to move out tomorrow to join our division on the Somme. In the p.m. 2 hun planes came out of the clouds & sent two of our balloons down in flames. We had at noon brought down one of their planes. Later in p.m. another was brought down near our lines and another made an attempt at our balloons but was brought down. This one I saw come down. My first.
