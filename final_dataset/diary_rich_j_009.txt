Sunday   Oct 11th It rained again this morning and caused the 6.30 drill to be postponed. Church parade at 9.30. I fell in with the Methodists and as they did not come down to the camp we waited until 10.30 and marched up to Bondi Junction. where they were holding the 70 th- anniversary The children sang splendidly, and all round it could be voted quite a successful morning. Miss A.B. Stout was waiting from 10.40 until I returned at 12.40 from Church. We wandered into Centennial Park and had lunch, I left her at 3.30 p.m. I missed the rollcall  at 2.30 but Sargent Griffiths cleared it up alright. I should have gone to Manly but I stayed in Camp all night.
