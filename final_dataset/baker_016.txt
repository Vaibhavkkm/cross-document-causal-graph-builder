France,  14/2/1918,
 Dear Jennie,  I received your letter  yesterday. Glad to hear you  missed any damage from the   last raid. How is the   "anemone japonica" getting along  I expect we will go in for  gardens in our new quarters  but I am afraid we shall be  rather late with the planting of  many seeds. Our gardens here  are most artistic  I am sorry little  Leslie was disappointed in me  but I'll repair the fault at once.
I like you have a   paucity of news. Its  very difficult to report on  anything here With regard  our our orchestra we are   not doing badly. I am   of course very slow & am  afraid I will never be   any good as my fingers  are too stiff & after a  little while I get the   cramp. Still I am   able to amuse myself  & in doing so, drive  everybody else away Ah! ah!  I had a letter from  Aunty Francis Her writing  is still very shaky
Well dear I must close  now. will write again after the  move.  Au-revoir Best of  love. Yours to a [[cinder?]] , Ernie.
