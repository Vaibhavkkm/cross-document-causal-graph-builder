My last letter told you about our raiding parties
and I'll [[?enlarge]] upon that & give more details.
During this period our raiders have crept out (blackened &
dressed as described - sneaked across No Man's Land  till they
are close to the wire which our fire is [[?s----]] up.
After a few minutes of Dante's Inferno [[their]] curtains fire
[[as]] befited & extended [[?---hy]] to C E F D.  This prevents any
reinforcements coming from the flanks - or from  X.
Directly our fire lifts our boys look in - scupper the 
Huns & scuttle off with any prisoners, badges etc to our
own trenches.  Is is the back track that brings our
casualties as the Enemy [[watches]] out from the flanks
at C.D  - with a cross fire from machine guns - Fritz
barrage - things are less safe than they might be - so you
may guess no one lingers on the back trip.
These raids are [[ ---t]]; they keep up our morale, & scare
blue snakes out of Fritz, keep us active, [[    t]] our boys [[---]]



I [[ ? ]] Hippo for a lighter and better beast from base 
a fine big black mare a real beauty,  in tip top condition. 
[[ perhaps?]] [[ ? ]] are getting leave to have a redo [[ round?]] in a day
or two as my [[?]] (White) [[ ? ]] she's getting bit frisky 
in weeks since Egypt.
The Russians seem to be [[ ? ]] strong, the French are
doing pretty well in the Somme - but so far the [[ ? ]]
have not done what was expected. Big Push later in
the [[Canadians?]], [[ ?]] Africa, & Anzacs will have their turn &
I guess something will shift then. [[ Irene? ]] will have read
about it in the papers long before this reaches you.
I will close now - dear[[?]], love  [[ ? ]] wishes from Rollo.

                                                                            14 - 7 - 16
Since I wrote we have travelled very many miles, [[ ?]]
now a good distance from the firing line. Our boys
are not yet in the Somme battle area - but we are
being held up in readiness to take our part soon.
At present we are being stiffened up - [[plenty?]] of [[scratches?]]
50 has fested over 40 miles last 3 days. [[Cuts aired?]] and
detained twice, and we are regular veterans as
regards being in the train/g " All our fear is cut down
to the [[?]], our transport follows us everywhere
in rear of [[ ? ]] Co, in the "Cocker" with steam up,
fires burning. Everything ready for our grub. A fine idea.

                                                                 Somewhere in France
                                                                                              17 -7 - 16 cont.
This morning (4.31) we marched 8 miles without [[brekker?]]
to this village . (don't know the name yet) where is about
12 miles from [[Doulleus?]]  on Germany side.
The inhabitants are the [[nicest?]] rural folk [[...... seas?]]
We were the first "Aussies" they had met - so that we
had a rough [[ ? ]] at first, I am [[?]] [[?]], last
wire across lanes, and one or two places we had to
literally force open. However they are quite [[ ? ]]
us & civilised now, & will do anything for us
The lady with [[ ? ]] Todd [[ ? Co?]] & I were [[billitted?]]
was a very crusty sort at first but now she has
changed right round, after grudgingly giving us a room
she can't do enough for us now - has found room 
for our [[domestiques?]] - [[(laterea)?]] & my "Chevaux". The 
mare has a [[tifa - tefa?]] stable  [[?as for]] wheaten hay -
[[ ? ]] the old dame just now gave the mare about
a complete haystack.
[[ ? ]] another place we were in ([[Etaries?]] Todd [[? had]]
great luck. We arrived after a night march at 3.30am
just as it was getting light.  The lady got up - made
us some coffee. My word it was good. We were there
only 12 hours but she looked after us well. Her only
son 'went out' last year - so you can guess her 
feelings against the [['Alleumaudes']] were intense.
That same afternoon Major Herbert & I were
[[defected?]] by the C.O to represent the 50 at a 

   East of [[Douttous?]]
                                                                                             14 - 7 - 16 (cont'd)
Mayoral Garden Party or At Home - and it
was dead funny. The hosts could not "compre" us.
nor could we 'compre' them - but we had a good time.
so you can guess it was a funny old life we had.
This village doesn't hold one inhabitant who can
"parlay vous Auglais", & as we "non compre Francois"
we get along very well with the townspeople.
Now we're out of Flanders, we've last truck with
the Fleurs - whom I believe to be pre-German in
sentiment and [[acture?]].
Our march this morning was quite Arcadian -
Woods, hills, gullies, real poetical brooks, meadows -
poppies, green grass, crops of ripening wheat, daisies,
red clover to growing wild in the fields - made our
route very beautiful. [[ ? ]] [[ ? ]] here like we had in
Flanders - [[ ? ]] are there the [[ many? ]] ditches ( a la 
[[...llicent?]] drains a la Flanders) for the land is
drained naturally.
This part of France (not Flanders) - is a very 
beautiful country and Sir Thomas More had
no need to go to America for his basis of Utopia.
for this country would have amply sufficed.
Goldsmith's Traveller describes it well - in fact
it is real poetry just to travel through it.
I used to think the "babbling brook" , "sweet smelling
[[furnesia?]]", "meadows [[ full ]] with daisies" all poetic [["toss"?]]
but my word we saw it in reality here = [[... ... ....?]].
