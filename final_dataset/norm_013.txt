Best Love to Flos Robbie  Mena Camp, Cairo, Egypt 
09/01/1915.     Dearest Mother & all at Home  This has been a red letter  week for me as I received no less than 6 letters at once &  of course I was the happiest man alive. I got one from  you, one from Mab & a Photo, one from May Tilton, 1 one  from Alice Cutler, & one from a Glaciarium Girl. Poor  old Jack Hall got none & nearly cried. I can only endorse  George's remarks about letters from Home Sweet Home. If we  have something nasty for dinner, we go & read our letters  again & this is as good as a dinner; Fortunately we get  the best of grub to eat & have little to complain about  in this respect. We have had a busy week this week  & the weather has been vile in the desert & the dust  storm, which lasts 4 days, played the very devil with  our eyes. We left the guns & wagons out there all night  & left a party of one Sergeant & 10 Gunners to look after  them and to dor the Gun Laying Tests under the Adjutant,  whilst the Drivers & Horses went back to Camp for  the night. I was left out the first night & after  doing my Laying Test, I slept under a Gun Limber that  night I thoroughly enjoyed myself, & after getting up at  7 am next morning, completed the Test before the rest  of the men and horses arrived. I am pleased to tell  you that I was the only one to Qualify in the Brigade
& I might state that I was the only Sergeant to pass.  I have had no practise of Laying since I joined  the Expeditionary force & of course was right out  of form, & not only that, it was sprung on the Sergeants  all of a sudden. We had no sooner finished with  the Gunners, when the Adjutant said, "now the Sergeants".  I felt anyhow, but as soon as I got to work, I felt  confident, & finished far before the Sergeants of the other  Batteries & all my Sights were set correctly so got Full  marks. The Dust storm we experienced is something awful  as there is a continuous blinding of fine dust all the time  & what with the whole of 3 Field artillery Brigades with  all their horses and vehicles doing manoevres, one can't  see his hand in front of him, & the Dust has got into all  the fine bearings of the Gun, however, we have had the  Guns to pieces & thoroughly cleaned & start shooting with  live shell on Monday next. One of the mares in   my Gun Team slipped a Foal during the night, but I am  sorry to say that the Foal died almost immediately.  Last Sunday afternoon, we paid a visit to the  Zoo, & enjoyed ourselves immensely, altho the Melbourne  Zoo is even better than the one we saw. After this  we dined "biggly" & then trammed it home to sleep.  We got several papers & pictures from the "Leader"  of the Expedry Force & it was quite a relish to see a  Melbourne paper once more, as the "Egyptian Mail" 
is a beastly "rag". Harry Braithwaite got Mabs  photo & is very pleased to know that she goes & sees  his Mother every now & then. We are all anxiously  looking forward to going to the "Front" & having a  "Box on" with the Germans, as we have been doing  the new Gun pit work & trenches of a night & I  can assure you that once a Gun is dug in, it is  a difficult matter to see anything at all from the  outside & this method had been found most  effective at the front & the percentage of casualties  have dropped from 75% to 5% since the outbreak  of the war, in the Artillery. I am sending you  some more Post Cards along with this letter &  I hope you got the box of Chocolate which I  registered & sent to you last mail. I write  as often as possible, which is once a week, & will  try & keep this up & hope you will let all kind  enquirers for me know that I am quite well &  appreciate their good wishes & am sorry I can't  write to them all. With fondest love to all,  & self, at home & elsewhere I am  Your loving Son,  Norman
