Dear Father I am still unable to tell you any news but will write a full account from England. The weather has become very hot lately, & consequently prickly heat is breaking out on board. Tom Cusack & I both suffered from it but are getting over it by degrees & hope for a cool change in a few days. I am still enjoying my life on a "troop ship" & it will be an everlasting experience to me. It has been marvellously calm which has made our work on board very much lighter in connection with the horses. We mostly exercise & rub down the horses in the mornings & attend lectures in the afternoons. There will probably be a Military exam when we reach England & am putting all my spare time into reading the subject up. 
There is a frightful lot to learn in so short a time & I will be competing against men who have had years of experience. I don't think I have a possible chance of passing but am going to have a try if I get the chance. I have learnt to like this Military life exceedingly but find myself frightfully handicapped in not having previous knowledge of the game & also my age is a great drawback. These old & proved soldiers despise we young bloods exceedingly so makes it very hard to hold your own with them. We have heard practically no war news since we left Fremantle, everything is kept very quiet. We will most likely not get our first mail from W.A. for a couple of weeks yet. I have been doing a little bit of boxing on board. There are several professional boxers here & amongst them is the ex- champion of W.A. & several other English professional pugs. 
From your loving son D. Barrett-Lennard. 

I have just five minutes to get into bed, all lights are put out at 9-15. Sharp. Xmas wishes to everyone & much love to all from Ever your affectionate son D. Barrett- Lennard
