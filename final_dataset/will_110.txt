52nd Battalion. 15 - 11 - 1917. Dear General Birdwood, Will you permit me to add my congratulations to the hundreds, I know, you will receive. We all know how well merited your promotion is, & feel proud that our General has been promoted. Besides, we recognise in it a distinct honour to the Anzac forces, of which you are happily the medium. Sincerely Yours, R.J. FitzGerald.
