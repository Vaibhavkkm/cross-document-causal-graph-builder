No 4 London General Hospital Kings College Denmark Hill London A & V Ward 4-9-1916  My dear Mum Arrived in this great City yesterday afternoon about 5 o' clock landed at Southhampton, hospital train from there to Waterloo station, thence on to hospital by motor abulance ambulance but being on my back all the time have had little chance of seeing anything yet however shall make up for it later. Have just had my leg under the X Ray but have not heard the result yet do not think anything is in it See you do not worry about me my wound is very slight and before you get this letter will most likely be back in France fighting Have been doing nothing else but travelling since leaving the line Was hit about midnight on 29th last month fought on for an hour after being hit then had my wound dressed & walked for 5 miles back got lost & ran into a Tommy dressing station from there got to our own dressing station at
Albert  from there by motor ambulance to an Officers rest home at Warley where I met Rupert Fisher who gave me a nice whisky & soda & bundled me off to hospital at Contay stayed there one night and went in hospital train to Rouen at this place one night then across to Southhampton by hospital ship so you see I have done some flying about in the last few days. Every one has been very nice & kind & do everything they can for you these hospital trains & boats are simply gorgeous & they feed you like kings. Still I feel as if I deserved a good time now for a bit as we have had a very rough time in France. We have been fighting mostly on the Somme front having a go for Moquet Farm a great strong hold of the Germans. & believe me it has been some stunt. There are several other officers from our battalion here so that when we can all get about what a good time we shall have  Also intend to look the good Hope Davies up & see what sort of a lass she is. Expect I shall have lots to tell you later when able to tear around this wonderful city. Lots of love to all Bob.
