Tuesday Sept. 22 nd
A route march of some 10 miles
out passed Maroubra this morning
I did not enjoy it a little bit Jack Sullivan marched out of step as usual and even the officers leading could not keep in step, and it jars my nerves to be walking without harmonising. I left the ranks without leave and went out in a sulky and lovely horse with Joe Neilson. Visited a few Hotels and met W.L. who is considerably worried. Had dinner & we went to Manly arriving back in camp at 12 o'clock, and found the boys had had no leave at all.
