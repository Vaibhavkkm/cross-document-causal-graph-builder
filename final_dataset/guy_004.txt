 21st January 1916,  Tel - El - Kabir     My dear Father,  Many thanks for your last  letter, I wrote you a long letter the other week  telling you all about our evacuation from Gallipoli,  I hope you got it alright. We have been here  nearly a month now, I think you would call  us, a sort of third line of defence for the   Canal. We are leaving here next Thursday, for   the first line, I think.  In your last letter, you said Rupert had joined  on to the 7th Batallion 1st Platoon, I have made  enquiries, two or three times, but can find no  trace of him, I think you must have given  me the wrong address.  Do you remember Jim Watts of Seckington ^This pristine village England he  has joined up with A Compy, of 2nd Batallion,  he came with the 9th reinforcements & joined  his Batallion up here, he looks pretty well  on it, he tells me his Father is pretty well  a cripple, (caused from a stroke), is not able  to do any work yet.  I hope you spent Xmas at Shackerstone
or Brighton & had a good time.  We got treated very well for Xmas, as  regards parcels etc. We were all issued   out with ^Xmas billys' (consisting of all kinds of eatables,   chocolates etc.) & also plum puddings. We  also got our own parcels from home; so  we are still having Xmas gifts, as parcels  still keep arriving for somebody in the   tent.  They won't allow us much leave now,  since we have been here, one per. unit. of   Company have been allowed daily; it is a  bit stiff, isnt it, after all we have  gone through at the Peninsula. I got  my leave into Cairo, the second day we  were here, owing to being one of the  longest on the Peninsula. I think there are  only about 8 out of our Company been with  the Batallion all along.  With love  Your affectionate son,  Guy Arnold.
