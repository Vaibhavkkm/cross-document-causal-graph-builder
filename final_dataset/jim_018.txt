My dearest Mother & Father,
I trust you will not be very 
grieved to hear I have left London 
and am going to be a soldier 
once more.  You must know how 
fed up and disgusted I have 
been during the past twelve months. 
It finally got unbearable and I 
threw in the sponge.  I am glad 
to say I go away without getting 
a crime against my name. 
I have been here 3 days 
now and am just dropping
into my stride.  The life is quite 
enjoyable and I shall be feeling 
the benefit of the change in a 
few weeks time.
I shall probably be just 
leaving England by the time
you get this letter.  I am quite 
confident that I shall come 
through alright and have no apprehensions about going back .
Les is at present on a few 
days leave in London, probably 
his last before going to France. 
I am only about 1½ miles distant
from his camp and shall see 
him next Tuesday.  I am 
trying to arrange a transfer to 
his brigade, not necessarily to his 
battalion.  I think it were best 
to address my letters to my pal 
as follows : -
3862 Private J.J Makin,
21st Battalion A.I.F
c/o Cpl. C F Juergens,
27 Chesilton Road,
Munster Park
London S.W.6.
When I am definitely settled I 
shall advise you further.
I met Graydon Burston, 
an old U.H.S boy, here yesterday. 
He has been over in England 
since October and, is likely to be
here on a base job for some time. I received your large parcel the 
day I marched out from London. 
I think it was the one you 
sent for my birthday.  It contained 
a large cake, sugar, cocoa, cafe' au lait, 
chocolate, cigarettes & and of course 
was very acceptable.  I am very 
grateful indeed.
I had a letter from Dr Gibson 
two or three days ago saying he 
had received some papers for me. 
I have told him to redirect them 
to me, but I am afraid they 
will never find me. 
My latest letter from you is 
dated 9/5.  There is a mail 
in dated about 23/5 but I 
have not got any letters up to 
date by that:  I must expect 
them to be delayed a while 
now.  I must ask you again 
not to worry about me.  I 
shall be as right as a bank. 
You must realize it is almost Two years now since I left 
my battalion, and that it is
time I did a bit more and
took a few risks.  Perhaps 
you will think that I do not
consider your feelings and
that I am inconsiderate, but
I repeat Lovelace's "Lines in
Going to the Wars" :—
   "Tell me not sweet I am unkind,
   ____  ____  ____  ___  ____  ____ etc
   "I could not love thee half so well
   "Loved I not honor more."
It were even so much better to
be stoical, and should bad news
ever reach you, bear it as did
the Spartan mothers of ancient
Greece.
I cannot write more now,
so will conclude with love to all
you dear people at home.  Believe
me, I am always thinking of you.
Your affectionate son
Jim
