Serapeum 30.3.1916 Mr. Donoghue Dear Sir, From the peninsular I wrote to you & let you  know that I was reverted to  the ranks when joining  up with the battalion and  consequently my pay was reduced.    I have now pleasure in informing  you that I have received my  commission as a 2/Lieut dating  from 16th March 1916. and of  course the extra sc pay which  same carries.  I have indeed  been lucky and consider I  did not deserve to get same  however some other officers  thought otherwise.  I am now  attached to A Company 13th. Battalion and have gone back to the  infantry side again.  Have just  completed a 3 weeks course  infantry course at the School  of instruction at Zeitoun and  although the work was hard  & strenuous  I did very well  the trouble of course being is  that a terrible lot of work  is got through in a very  short period.  However when  finished I had 4 days leave  and had the time of my  life visiting Alexandria &  Cairo having a good fly  around in each city.   We are out in a spot now  which seems to some to  be right in the middle  of the desert miles away  from anywhere also the weather is becoming beastly  hot and dusty so that  the sooner we move across  to France the better  anticipating   merely supposition  on our part that we are  going there but everyone here  sincerely hopes so this place  will be very unpleasant  during the summer which is  now starting with a vengence   Since coming away from  Lemnos Island after the  evacuation from the peninsular  we have been camped at  Ismailia, Moascar, & Tel-el- Kebir where the training has  been regular and solid,  so that we all feel ready  and fit for another go at  the real thing.  Trusting you are fit and well and will  you kindly remember me to  all at the company also  hoping to have the pleasure  of seeing you again in the  near future. I remain  yours. truly Robert J. Henderson
