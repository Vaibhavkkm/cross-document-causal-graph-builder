Text:  Dear Miss Allen  I received your ever welcome letter  yesterday and I though I would answer it straight away.  I was very sorry indeed to know  that I did not  receive your letter before I left Sydney. I left for home  on the 14th and your letter was wrote on the 11th.  I can quite understand how, I never received it. When I  gave the reported, the particulars about your Brothers  I was at that time stationed at Randwick Hospital,  but a few days after, I left and was staying at my  friends place at Lindfield. I seen a good lot of your  Brothers from the time I meet them, and was not more  than five yards off when the shell caught us. Your two  poor Brothers were between my Brother & I.  When the shell had exploded I knew by the screams  that someone had caught it. I could not get through  for sometime , as I was half silly through the shock.  However when I could get through, my Brother was  seriously wounded and your to Brothers were laying  there, they had been shifted, because when I was  returning to the front line again I could not see them  My Brother is having a rough time he is still in 
hospital , he cannot Walk but gets about on  crutches, as best he can. I expect he will be home  in a few months time. I am pretty well again  my hand is not much good to me at present,  but I have hopes that in time it will come  alright. I will more then likely be in Sydney  Wednesday or Thursday, and if I am, with your  Kind permission I will come and see you.  I hope you can understand this scribble.   I Remain  Yours Sincerely  Will Hale
