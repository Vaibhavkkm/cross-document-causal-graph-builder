 My dear Mum, Received quite a decent mail  yesterday one letter from you one from  Mick one from Lorna one from Betty  Bull one from Lucy Cowdery all dated  28th May it was great having all the  news when I will be able to answer  them all goodness only knows do not  seem to have any time at all  for writing letters these days however  always try to write home at least   once a week and let the others rip  Any spare time I have is taken  up by riding out to get a decent  bath or chasing around to see Nane  or some of the boys or perhaps playing  cricket for the Battn coaching the  boys etc & occasionally a little dinner  and bridge party at one of the other
Coy messes. All this with preparing   lectures for officers and senior N.C.O.s  (I have to give one next Tuesday on   The Training of Bombers) & the training &   running of a Coy of men does not  leave very much time to ones self.  Am enclosing the menu of a little dinner  we gave the other night to the Coy other  Coy commanders of the Battn it was  quite a good effort I invited Glen  Satchell and another Doc to but they  were unable to come they took a walk  across last night & we had some bridge  Hana sent word across he was coming  over to see me this afternoon but as  I have to go about 5 miles to attend  a lecture at 4PM also another one  at 5PM expect I shall miss him  which will be rotten luck. It was   very wet the other afternoon so decided  to run a voluntary concert in a barn  where the Coy is billeted all done  on the spur of the moment took the  gramaphone across you would have   been surprised ay the talent shown  we had great fun the boys enjoyed it  immensely. 
Received a reply from B.N.S.W London   who have cabled for £1oo to be transferred   to my account there and charged my  account account with the cost of same  19s/6d also telling me when they receive  a reply they will notify me do not  want the money at present but  think it is a good idea to have  some money on this side of the  world in case one never know what   will happen these times. If I get  properly banged one of these times  do not forget there might be some  money to my credit in London which  could then go back to Australia.  You want t know more about the   little girl in England but it is   not worth while Mum do not think  I was or am in love with her she  only interested me while in London of  cours same as many others there. Major  marks is doing splendidly and should   be back with the Battn any time now 
Capt Murrays promotion to Major has  just come through so expect you will  see me a budding Captain one of these  fine days Well Mum I might  ramble on indefinitely but beleive  me time will not allow am feeling  quite off the mouth & teeth trouble  me occasionally but have had no  trouble to date with both wounds  lots of love to all am very tired  of all this business and if it is  to be shall be very glad to get  back again as soon as possible,   Boby
