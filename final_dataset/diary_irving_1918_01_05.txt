Up at 6:00. Reveille 6:15. Breakfast, steak, oatmeal, coffee. Tidy up thoroughly for Company Inspection. Platoon was inspected, O.K. Inspection arms and the rest of the day to ourselves. Coal situation on the railroads so bad that only 4% of each company is permitted to go home on pass. In our company 8 passes. Lt. McMurtry is promoted to Captaincy. Capt. McMurtry announces a special mess for evening to men who must remain in barracks. He tries to get 308th band, but fails. While on parade, I see a nickel on ground and almost get into trouble because I want to pick it up. Bravest act of my life so far to resist temptation to stoop for it. I go back to look for it when dismissed but cannot find it. Read, loaf, and doze. Dinner, bean soup, potatoes, roast beef, beets, coffee. Time hangs heavy. I begin to miss Leah greatly and am minded to ask for a pass. I call her up at 4:00. She is very much disappointed and cries, which affects me so that I forget to tell her what I want to. She promises to come the first train tomorrow. I promise to call her in the morning, but later find that I cannot get to telephone early enough. I take a nap. Roll call at 5:00. Supper, meatballs, rice and raisins, tea. An entertainment is arranged for 8. Read, make bed. An excellent pianist from another company plays for us, and a great many more numbers, some very good, are put on. Bishop and his jazz. band. Al Cahill, a former Hippodrome dancer, and a boxing bout. Our Mess crowded with visitors. Fine spirit among boys who volunteer to entertain. Call up Leah again and make plans for Sunday. Refreshments. Ice cream, candy, cake and cider. Bed at 10:00. Do not sleep well. Cough. McAuley, McGay and Nicholas go to CT Camp.
