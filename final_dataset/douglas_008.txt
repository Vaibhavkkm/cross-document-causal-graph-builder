July 22nd 1915  Dear Mr Lennard  I deeply regret that your son  Douglas died here last Sunday night after  being most grievously wounded while  serving his Gun in action.  I deeply deplore his loss to this  force & I sympathize with you & yours  from my heart in your great sorrow. May  I however offer you some consolation where  I tell you that the lad had nobly done  his duty from the time he joined the  Battery until he died - he was wounded  gallantly fighting his Gun against a very  severe shell fire by the Enemy & when  taken away by loving comrades his first  thought was for his wounded companions -  whom he asked should be attended to before  him.  He bore his terrible sufferings with heroic  courage & fortitude, was clear & conscious to   the last & gave his final message to  those he loved so well, calmly & fearlessly.  he set an example for gallantry self  sacrifice & fortitude which I cannot think  can be supposed & which will be 
handed down in his famous Battery  for many a long year to come.  His loss is not in vain - he has  nobly served his Country & done all  that a man can do - died a brave &  glorious death for it. His loss is  deeply mourned by the very large  number of sincere friends he had made  in the service & especially in the  Battery he loved & served so well.  Yours sincerely,  J.T. Hobbs. Colonel.  Commanding Divisional  Artillery  1st. Aust Btn.
