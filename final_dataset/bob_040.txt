France 2-8-1916. My dear Mum Sorry I have not written for about 10 days or so but we have been so busy moving about marching from one place to another and with hot weather one is very tired at the end of each day. We are very close to the firing line again and expect to be well in it again at any time in fact we have all dumped our stuff here and are to be ready to move out at an hours notice Sorry I cannot mention names of towns etc we stay at and pass through which would make a letter much more interesting Had a bottle of champagne with Rupert Furber last night here he is with the 4th Field Ambulance & is very well incidentally told him I expected to see him professionally shortly and squared him to send me direct on to London which he promised to do. Also believe Bobby Taylor is in this town but have not yet run into him.  Nana is just behind us somewhere but cannot get away to see him as we may move at any moment so that it is not wise to go far away from the battalion. I am now Battalion Bombing officer and am responsible for training etc of my own platoon of bombers also U each Companys bombers in the battalion so that I am the hard working king at present however expect all my troubles shall be over shortly as the battalions returning from the line seem terribly short of bombers but it is very interesting work and find I can throw as far if not further and as accurately as any one in the battalion (thanks to cricket) so that given a fair duel with any German feel sure he would get the worst of it There have been several duels bombing duels our bombing platoons against the Germans on this front the last one I heard of recently was lasted for 2 hours out of 36 two of our chaps came out alive and there was one German left who xxxxxxxx threw in the sponge Just fancy the excitement in a word for instance it will always do me shall be glad to get in & finish this show one way or another am getting feed up of this game but all the same sort of feel one is doing ones duty and should not like to be back in Sydney at present without a reasonable excuse Never mind Mum dear expect all this terrible business will be over some day or then they say you know the first five years of any war is always the worst what do you think.  We are at present billeted with a very nice French girl & her Mother both play auction bridge well also make good cider & have a fine gramaphone then we buy all sorts of nice things for supper each night so am not doing too badly Have been out this afternoon with my chaps throwing live bombs for practice we had some great competitions which created much keeness amongst the boys When finished bombing I had some revolver practice & managed to win a free bottle of champagne over it. Yesterday I saw 15 airoplanes flying just above me and they all landed with 10 yds of me also 6 others ascended from the same spot it was most interesting and one of the finest sights I have ever seen You will never kid me to pay 5/- to go and see fireworks or airoplanes again have also seen some good air fights between the Huns and ourselves we have them well bluffed it is a most interesting spectacle. Have not received letters for some time except from England but have no doubt all this moving about accounts for it. Well we have a night stunt on tonight so will have to go & do a bit but are having some supper when we get back lots of love to all shall write again at first opportunity from Bob
