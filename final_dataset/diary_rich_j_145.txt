December 1st.  Friday.     Joined up 1st Battalion. After packing up and finding that there was no train going to Ailly we hung on expecting the Battalion to march into Ribemont this afternoon, sure enough at dusk they came along, we met Lieut. Summerset, got billets and moved over in the night time. At night the Adjutant, Mr. Edgerly was very good and considerate, we met a whole lot of officers and were made at ease. Lieut. Wells, Q.M. was obliging and took an order for all manner and kinds of clothes and equipment to be delivered in about 8 days time. I have two stars from Wallace Neve, I want two more for my top coat. Boots have got me down just now I badly want a good strong pair.
