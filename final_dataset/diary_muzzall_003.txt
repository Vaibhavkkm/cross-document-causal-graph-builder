On August 13, one hundred of us were sent to the Veterinary Training
School, Camp Lee, Virginia. Our journey took us through Kansas City, St. Louis,
Cincinnati, and through West Virginia and Virginia. To my surprise there were oil
fields in southern Illinois and Indiana. Tobacco and cotton was not so surprising in
Virginia. The poverty in the mountainous regions of West Virginia was
depressing. Finally we were in the Blue Ridge Mountains and then entered the
James River Valley which we followed until we arrived at Petersburg and Camp
Lee nearby. This was a huge base where many troops received their final training
before going overseas. Here we immediately began taking the final preparation.
Our date of arrival at Camp Lee was August 17, 1918.
During the first week or ten days, I was able to visit the site of the Battle of
Petersburg of Civil War fame, the city of Petersburg and Richmond, the latter only
once. These cities looked old and interesting and very different than our Western
and Midwestern cities.
We were immediately organized into Veterinary Replacement Unit #2 for
overseas assignment. Lt. Bowman, our company adjutant, both at Fort Riley and
here, had frequently urged that I apply for officers’ training camp here and had, in
fact, made a formal recommendation to the Captain that I be backed for this
assignment. More and more responsibility was given to me in handling various
duty assignments. Most of our men were drafted in early July from the poorer
sections of New York City. They were an unusual breed to me and not very easy
to get along with. Most of the acting non-coms (I had been named as acting
sergeant) were from the Riley group. We had platoon, company and battalion foot
drill and night drill under full pack and war conditions.
