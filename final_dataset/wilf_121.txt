My dear mother, I am still enjoying my trip to hospital & expect to return next Sunday.  It has been a treat to have time fully occupied here as I have had 150 patients to look after & they take quite a lot of time. Then we have swimming, I often go in three times a day as it is quite handy & then we sometimes go to tennis in Port Said which is very pleasant.I have chummed up with a Major Brown here, one of the surgeons, & we took a couple of the nurses to tennis one afternoon & dinner afterwards. Another afternoon Comins who is a dentist formerly attached to the 3rd LHF Amb, & now down here, & I went down with another couple of nurses one afternoon to the Armenian refugee camp which is a few miles down the canal from here. We sailed down & the girls had a lot of shopping to do for different people as the Armenians make handkerchiefs, laces etc, & sell quite a lot of stuff. When I saw the hankys I thought you & Mab might like some so I bought a dozen & also a quaint little coat which I thought might be of use for one of the young nieces or nephews, whichever it would fit. It was quite a queer little thing & looked as if it might be useful At any rate I hope you like the handkerchiefs. An Australian mail has arrived, but I have rather missed it, as it has probably gone out to the field
for me & won't get mine for a few days. When we were at the Armenian camp our boat cracked it's sail & couldn't return, so we had to breast up to a naval officer who was there with a fine motor launch & was buying some things with some ladies, & we asked him if he would rescue us as there were no other boats. He was very decent about it & off we went in great style & had some tea in Port Said on our way back. Quite a number of officers I know are sick in hospital here & I often pop in & have a talk with them so that time goes very rapidly I'm not looking forward very much to returning to the field & the valley of the Jordan but it must be done so there's no use regretting it. We went over one day & had a look over a boat which is returning to Australia with sick & wounded shortly & upon which I hope to send this letter with some of the people who are travelling on her. She was very much fitted out & comfortable & I certainly wished that I could stow myself away on her somewhere. I will have more to say I hope when I receive my mail my dear so will close this with the very best of love & many a big hug from Your loving son, Wilf. If I succeed in sending this by a passenger, I expect you will get this letter in the shortest time for a long while.
