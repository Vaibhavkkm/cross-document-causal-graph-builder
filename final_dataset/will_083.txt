8.5.1917.     My dear Birdie.  Neill went up to explain   how things stand this morning.  I am awfully disappointed at  your not getting out for the rest   you all deserve so much. But  I dont see any way out of the   difficulty. We are left with the  battered 62nd & 7n Divns -   & the raw 58th - & it would not   be possible to hold our present
front with only those 3 Divns   especially having regard to the   extremely sore point we have thrust  into the side of the Bosche.   Things would ease down a lot   if & when the III Army would   come along, but their advance seems   problematical, & anyhow till they   do, there seems no other possibility   than to keep in some of your Divns  All that can be done, is to   try & keep things fairly quiet,   to let as many officers & men go   on leave as possible, & to get you   all out later. I've have just been   speaking to Tandy - at G.H.Q.   & he says there is a chance of   getting you all out in a months   time, & on the strength of that, I   will write a letter asking officially   that that should be done   if the military situation 
makes it at all possible.  Meanwhile I hope you &   your staff will be able to get   away on a spell of leave by   driblets from now on -  Yrs ever  H.P. Lynch
