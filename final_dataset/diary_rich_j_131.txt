November 18th.  Saturday. I slept in a canvas shake-down last night under the shafts of a waggon. I thought I heard rain falling in the early morning. The previous night it was anti-aircraft guns and air bombs falling that woke me up. This time it was a kind of mysterious patter on the canvas, not rain quite but what else could it be? When Winzar got out at 7.30 I found it was snow that caused me to think during the darkness. Anyhow, thinks I, snow and frost is, at any rate, better than rain and mud. But alas, before 10 a.m. it commenced to rain and has been raining on and off until now, 8 o'clock. This makes me swear as I fear for wet feet, I will be getting lumbago again. I half expected the 1st Battalion to send for me today, not that I am over anxious or fretting in the slightest about my new position. It will all work out well I am quite certain. Some of the fellows say I'm a damn fool and all the rest of it, as we all know how officers are cut up, but this I can’t help. I've been called upon and willingly I go. Never mind the outcome, if its only a wound I will get the best - 17 - possible treatment. Oh, but it is nonsense to talk about getting hit etc. As I have often said, "If there's a bullet or a shell with my name and address on it, its no use dodging it" I have packed my kit up and although I have no clothes or anything else much, I am ready to move into the new position.
