previous letter News is very same here nothing really to tell you all except we are again out for a very few days and everyone on this side is very busy as you can imagine ere you receive this letter you will have read a lot in the papers about the 
doings at present  on this side of the world and believe me the Australians are playing a large part in it all. Glad to hear all about yourselves and the good times you have had down the coast Nana is quite all right as far as I know he is further South at present so have no chance of seeing him at present however expect things will settle down eventually at present they are a bit upset. Have no news that for you that I can say in a letter still going strong but not feeling the best in the world lots of love to all, Bob
