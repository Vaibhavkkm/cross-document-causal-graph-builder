Notes.

1 Brother-in-law, Edgar H. Prather, husband of his sister Hattie.
2 From the Long, Long Trail website: The 34th Division suffered very severe casualties during its part in
the defense of Kemmel, and was withdrawn and reorganized. In mid-May 1918 the Divisional infantry was
reduced to a training cadre, and used for training American troops. Many reduced units were attached for
short periods at this time. It was reconstituted as a full first-line Division late in June 1918.
3 No. 9 was a pill containing a laxative.
4 Drug introduced in 1887 as an analgesic. It was removed from the market in 1983 when it was linked to
kidney damage.

1 Watou is just west of Poperinge, Belgium.
2 Now Grover in back in France.

1 Probably the Authie river which runs by Doullens.
2 I posted this entry on the Great War Forum and received the following information. The “Maj. Geer?” in
Grover’s diary seems to be William Wells Greer M.D. who practiced medicine in Edinburgh after the war.
He was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1914 and earned a Military Cross during his
military service.
3 Here is some information submitted by Jim Strawbridge to the Great War Forum: Ackimzey notes the
bombing of 3 Can. Stat. Hospital in which mention is made of four doctors, four nurses and 17 others killed. A source that I found notes three nurses and two doctors having been killed the nurses being Dorothy Mary Yarwood Baldwin, Agnes MacPherson and Eden Lyal Pringle (all Canadian Army Nursing Service). I assume the fourth to be Gladys Mary Maud Wake who died three days later from serious leg
injuries.
