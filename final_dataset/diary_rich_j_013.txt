Thursday  Oct. 15th It is raining this morning, it having started yesterday afternoon, so we done no physical drill. The fact that war troubles threaten South Africa, and Father laying dying makes me worry very much over Mother & her future life. Bert is, I expect, having a pretty miserable time garrisoning up in those cursed Islands of the North. Things are taking the appearance of a near removal. I hope it will be so, but the possibility of going to South Africa seems to loom up largely, which is very annoying, as I dont want to rough it on the veldt. I caught the 5-45 boat for Manly, had dinner at Btainrig. Win seems to be getting a stronger hold as time goes on. I got back to camp safely but luckly at 12.30.
