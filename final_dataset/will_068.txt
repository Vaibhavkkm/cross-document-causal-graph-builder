GENERAL HEAD QUARTERS,  BRITISH ARMIES IN FRANCE.  19TH FEBRUARY, 1917.  No. MS/H/ 4806.   My dear General  With reference to your letter of the 16th instant,  the following is the correct position regarding the award  of Foreign decorations to British Officers & Men.  Anyone is eligible for a decoration from each Allied  Power provided he is nominated by name by that Power.  This is what you refer to as a "personal" decoration.  No officer or man (excepting in the case of officers  of the highest rank) may be proposed by the Commander-in-  Chief for more than one decoration " out  of  a  bag".  Therefore, an officer or man may have one decoration  on the nomination of the C-in-C, plus as many as he is  nominated for by Allied Powers.  The Montenegrin decorations were considered "personal"  decorations.  I have heard nothing about the French calling for  further names.  Yours   WE Peyton   Lt-Gen. Sir W.R. BIRDWOOD,
