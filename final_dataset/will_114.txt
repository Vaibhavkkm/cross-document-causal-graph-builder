REGENT PALACE HOTEL, PICCADILLY CIRCUS,
LONDON, W.1. 23rd November 1917 Dear General. Just a line to say goodbye I expect to leave for Australia in a few days time. I trust its needless for me to say how very sorry I was to be no longer able to serve under you. I have finished well in that I am able to say I Terminated my service under the most distinguished and brave General of this age. I was so glad a few days ago to see you had been elevated to the rank of full General, and I heartily congratulate you My wife will remain in England until such time I know what shape my future is to take
Yours Sincerely. Stephen Midgley.
