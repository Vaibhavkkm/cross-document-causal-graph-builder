The Artillery can either make or mar in "Raid's" success
If the wire isn't smashed - or a thick [[barrage?]] doesn't   
come between the first [[?forward]] line of enemy trenches - 
[[?then]] the raiding party has a very "rough" [[skin?]] - very
few will get back.
 
Most of our raids have been absolutely free from casualties
[[?]] the "[[jetting?]] home" began - as these Fritz begins to
[[?]] a barrage of machine gun Artillery between his [[?]]
ours, so the return party shifts like greased lightning.
Much pain and detailed work occur in planning a raid
-a few lines of description of a successful raid - means
the result of many hours of careful study & planning.
To see a party go out one would fancy it was some sort
of "fancy dress stunt".  The men black their faces, hands &
wear any old clobber - carry rifles with blackened bayonets 
fixed - knives, [[?]], [[?bombs]], [[knobkerries]] - (last are
[[entrenching?]] tools with a bit of horseshoe fixed on  for luck
My word, Ned Kelly would turn with envy in his
grave if he were only told about our ideas & "get up"
If you can imagine the effect on [[?poor]] [[?Hans]] of this
mob of yelling Australian "blacks" jumping into the
remnants of their trenches after 30 min. of our "[[?hate]]".
Poor devils - I heard they are going to crucify any
Australian they catch with a 'Knobkerry" but they'll
have "First to catch him."  I saw some Fritzes on
their way to our H.Q.] after a good raid last night.




                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              27
By the time they reached us they had lost many [[?buttons]]
[[?our]] boys are great in [[?c--]] and it was one of the
funniest sights in the world to see a ragged six footer
of an Anzac - (black! escorting an equally gigantic
Fritz.  Bill [[?]] had a "knobkerry" & was helping Fritz
along by waving his brass helmet - but as B.I. was
wearing a head of about size 7 & Fritzy helmet only
filled a size 6 - you can imagine the picture. Especially
if you fill up the most picturesque  & sanguinary
[[Australian---?]] which B.I. used  with various yelled
war-cries to hurry  Fritz along. Some of our
wounded came along later. Some laughing, some
silent, others [[?]] & cursing generally. My word
B.I. can swear when put to it properly. 
I hope to take out a party before long - it might
[[?]] a M.C. or - but one must trust to luck -
I dont intend to miss any opportunities, & besides
"one hour of [[?glorious]] [[?fame]] is worth a month of ordinary [[?]] fame"
I enclose 'Birthday dinner card" - of party given by
Major Jack - only 1100 yds from firing line.  Keep
the "menu" for the autographs may be valuable.
Well - I'll write again in a few days -
Best of all good wishes - & very much love - hoping
you're all as well as I am
                                             Yours Rollo
