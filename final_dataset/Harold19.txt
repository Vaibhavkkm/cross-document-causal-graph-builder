I am by no means a hero. I don't mind admitting I
dread these beggars. I have seen the effect of them - 
they're about the limit. They [[?]] about 6' or 9' with
the ground - & blow out a hole to that depth and
about same diameter. I have seen the damage that
20 of these did to some trenches - 150 men took 4 hours
to repair them next night. They can be dodged with
luck - but without luck - !!
 
However where they use these fakes, we reply with
"pudding" bombs.  A pudding for a family of no [[?]]
their size - so you can guess Fritz doesnt [["stomach"]] them much.
Fritz is a shrewd Enemy, uses all sorts of tricks, but
as you know we don't use our brains at all, so they
do as they like - I don't think!! I could tell you a
few tit bits concerning the [[?hobby?]]. I am now - busy with-
but of course I must obey the Censor's rules. Fritz
is shrewd & clever;- they have taught us much, and
I really believe we will be excellent pupils.
Birdwood inspected us yesterday & told us we
would have "plenty of "it" directly" so we are expecting a
journey over the [[?top]] soon.  I have put my name for
"Blighty leave" well down on the list - altho' its really
due this week - but having brought the boys so far. I
think it my duty to take them [[?into]] Fritz territory.
 
We are exceedingly busy night & day, so I am tired
now - but will write later. But of all good luck, success,
happiness, much love, hopes you are as well as 
Your loving [[?Rollo]]
