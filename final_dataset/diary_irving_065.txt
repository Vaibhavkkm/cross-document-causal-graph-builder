Tue. Mar. 19, 1918
Weather: fine, clear Health: good
Up at 6:00. Reveille. Breakfast. Shredded wheat, bacon, coffee. Police platoon room. Formation outside. Half of company is taken away for detail work. I remain and am surprised to find myself corporal, acting Lieut. Wilhelm in charge. I make a good showing, no errors. Drill an hour. A new job found for us. We must police roads all around barracks. My squads shirk. I do more work than any of my men. Inside to have blankets, slicker belt, canteen cover, shelter tent half, and cartridge belt stamped with my company number, 70. A long wait till my turn comes. Read paper. Find an opportunity to speak to Lieut. McDougall about a pass, so that I can make final plans to dispose of my business. Impossible except if I can get permission of Capt. to speak to major Budd. I go looking for Capt., find him in my platoon room with Lieut. Cook laying out a model cot with equipment spread out for inspection. Talk to him, but get refusal. He reminds me that I overstayed leave last pass. Sit about making up my bunk as model. Dinner. Pork and beans, coffee. Inspection announced at 3. New men, who are at rifle range, of which there are 3 in my squad, must have their cots made up too. I am detailed to do so. A warm job. Have a helper who is helpless. Make up all these and get back to my bunk just in time to be inspected. Passed OK. Put things away. Read. Take a nap. Outside to relieve old guard. My name is posted. Retreat. Guard formed, informal. Band is escorting a funeral, which passes in sight as we stand retreat. Supper. Steak, peas, potato, cocoa. A letter from Leah telling me that Nuck Sachs has sent a telegram to Pres. Wilson, offering to go to France in my stead. Remarkable. Ernest of friendship. Write to Leah and Mama. Get a package of cake and fruit from Mama. Go to Post Office to mail letters. Take a half hour nap. Outside for guard. Post 6. 10 to 12. Lieut. Cook tricks me into giving up my gun, a thing which I must under no circumstances do. A fine night, pleasant work. After 11, I run into Lieut. Cook and Capt. coming out of orderly room. I do not halt them, because I know them. Get a lecture from Lt. Prowiss to do better next time. They go rounds of posts. I catch them on Fifth Ave. and make a bold attempt to halt them. Manage to ball it all up. Lt. comes so close to me that he has an opportunity to grab my gun. Just manage to hold on to it. Get hell this time. Relieved at 12. Take half hour to Post Relief. Get three hours sleep in my clothes, with my gun in bunk laid over. An angry thought comes to me. Out again at 3:30. Relieved at six. See beautiful sunrise. Halt and interrogate Lt. Stevens properly. Have some funny experiences, halting privates, who are crossing street to latrines. Find a book, which I turn in. An interesting night’s work. Officer, whom I salute, corrects me. Tired and a little chilled. Have learned something at any rate.
