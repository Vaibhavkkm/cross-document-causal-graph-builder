 Sunday 28th November, 1914.  Dearest Mother Hope you got my last letter from Aden alright; I have not much to tell you this time as the trip to here has been uneventful Aden is not much of a place, & certainly no place for a white man to live in, altho' there are some there. The houses there are very much like those at Colombo & the inhabitants are Jews, Somali's, & Arabs. The place is the most hilly & rugged place one could imagine & the natives mostly travel in a "jig jog" trot like Chinamen. The vehicles are drawn by Camels & these creatures are very numerous The Jews & Arabs came out to us in their boats & sold good of all descriptions at of course impossible prices & came in for severe handling of the chaps tongues. Matches 1/- a dozen & prices like that. It is interesting to watch the Arabs coal our ship, they all jabber like a lot of monkeys & everybody is yelling at once & nobody takes any notice of what the other says, but they can get through the work alright, & the most wonderful thing is, they worked all day & never had a bite to eat, & it was after 8 o'clock when the 
tug boat came to take them off. We left there after loading & passed Perrim & Hells Gates & here we could see the hulls of wrecked boats & apparently this place is not ill named. Coming through the Red Sea, we passed a big boat packed with people & our Warship went out & pulled her up with a shot in front of her bows, & when she stopped, she proved to be a boat load of Pilgrims coming back from Mecca after some Annual Religious Festival, so she was allowed to go on. We had a death on board 2 days ago; one of the Ammunition Column chaps had the measles but got down in the dumps & died so we buried him 2 hours later. It is very impressive, as all Ranks fell in in their proper places & a shoot is pushed out over the side & attached by ropes so that it can be tilted. The body was placed in a packing case & some firebars & cable chain packed in with him & holes drilled in the box to admit the water, & when the Coffin was placed on the shoot, our boat pulled out of the line & stopped & then the service was read & the shoot tilted & down he went with a splash & the boat goes on just as before. He came from Gippsland. & the Dr said that if he had any heart, he would have got better. There is some beast just a few Cabins down that is playing on a confounded mouth organ. I can't imagine any punishment bad enough for him.
We have just been told that we go to Egypt (Cairo) & we expect to land there on Tuesday. Cairo is about 12 hours train journey from Alexandria & after completing our training there we proceed to the south of France & there go to the front. Most of the fellows are rather disappointed at not seeing England first, but if we went to England, we would not see Egypt. Personally I am pleased as I am just simply chock & full up of the boat & every body else is. It has been a very calm voyage & I have not been sick since leaving Albany, but it is terribly monotonous & one wakes up in the morning anything but fresh but we improve after breakfast. It is fairly hot in the Red Sea, but I have known hotter days in Melbourne. The reason why we go to Egypt is that it is too wet in England to do our training there Well I think I have told you all the news at present Mother so with fondest love to everybody at home & elsewhere I remain Your loving son Norman  Give my love to Floss Robbie I hope you are all well.


I have not received any letters from Victoria yet, but hope they are at Port Said
