18th May 1915  Gaba Tepe     My Dearest Mother & all at Home,  Just another line  to let you know that I am still quite  well & getting used to Active Service.  The Turks are a peculiar crowd &  don't relish fighting at all. Their  Artillery is a little troublesome at   times, but we will soon polish them  off. Today was Mail Day & I got  quite a budget of letters & I have  just got through them all in my  "dug out", where I have spent the  best of the day. My Subsection had   to relieve "D" Subsection for a week  & I just came off today. The guns  are all well dug in & it is nice & comfy  in them, but we are not allowed  to go near them when we are not firing. The British & French at the  lower end of the Peninsular are  finding it a little tougher than  they expected, as the Turks are  so well dug it, & the Allies  Artillery bombarding can be heard  all day & all night long. They are  simply going to blow the place  to bits & then chase them with  the bayonet. My word, Mum, I  hope you will be proud of the  Australian Infantry. If you could  only see the place they have  taken from the Turks, it would  cause you to marvel. It is  that rough & rugged & steep  that one can scarcely climb  it alone & yet they charged &  drove the Turks out at the  point of the bayonet. The  Turkish prisoners said it 
was terrible to try & stop them.  The Sailors off the battleships  were amazed at them & at once  named them the White Gurkas  & truly they have earned it.  Last week, the Victorian  Infantry were withdrawn from  here & sent down to help the  Tommies & French take some  position that was causing  a bit of trouble & when the  Victorians arrived, they let  out one wild yell & flew at  them & drove the Turks out  flying. They have one fault, &   that is the wont wait for an  order & their officers can't hold  them. As soon as they were  told where they had to go, they  went of their own accord  & the officers simply had to
  go with them, or else get lost  The Light Horse are all  here (dismounted) & are doing  work in the trenches & are  simply itching for a bayonet  charge, but we only have to  hold this position until the  other force drive up the Turks  from the lower end. Never shall  I forget the sight on the Sunday  we landed here. We sailed  slowly out of Lemnos at night  & anchored outside till day  break & then followed the  warships around & when we  got in sight of the coast, there  were all over our warships pouring  in tremendous broadsides. The  noise was terrific & the effect of  the flashes from gun fire was  simply wonderful, & all this 
was going on whilst we were landing  in boats. The noise that  Queen Lizzie was making, was  shaking the whole world it  appeared to us. Eight 15 inch  guns all going at once. And  the other fro  boats had 12 inch  guns going. There were about  20 war boats & all were going out at  once, so you can imagine what  the noise was like.  All day, today, the Turks have  been shelling us, but have done  no damage what ever & have  succeeded in wasting a lot of  ammunition. The Turkish  Infantry tried a bayonet charge  last night & our boys gave them  a lasting remembrance of what  they got before. The German  Officers have to threaten them to 
make them do it. On the back  & I & my subsection have not  got our gun back yet, but it  is on board the H.M.S. Prince  of Wales being repaired & hope  to have it soon. We had a   most unpleasant duty of having  to bury some of our Infantry  dead last week & they had   been killed on the first day  of landing & were of course  "pretty high" but we soon got  the job through. We had a   rotten day on my birthday  Gunner Beulke was killed by   a fall of earth. Lieut Wolfenden  was killed by shrapnel, Arthur  Mann was wounded in the face  & Gnr Collins was hit in the back,   & this was the day my gun  was blown up by the Turks, so
I'll not forget my 29th birthday in  a hurry. I hope you enjoyed your  holiday in Creswick. I am very  glad you went. Tell Mab, that  Verne Ritchie endorsed one of the  letters I got & said that he had  written to her. I got a letter from  Floss & one from Rupert, 2 from  Mab & one from Nell Wheeler. I  cannot write to them as I have no time  & no materiel , so hope they will accept  my apologies & thanks. We get good  food such as Bacon Cheese, Tinned   meat & vegetables & tons of biscuits, &  plenty of tea & sugar.  Well Mother dear must close  now as it is mail time so with  best of love to all & yourself  I remain  Your loving son, Norman 

May 18      Please write to Ruby Davidson  51 Highett St  West Richmond  for me please  

I know I am a   nuisance.  Braith & all the Drivers have  not been ashore yet, & have gone back  to Alexandria
