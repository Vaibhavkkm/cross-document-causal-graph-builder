Text:
  No news to send, lately no news have come,  Very little doing anyhow - & any trifling  incident is amusing. A Taube came over  and dropped 2 bombs near our Store depots.  & when our machine guns got busy - Fritz  delighted us by "looping the loop" and showed  he was a 'sport' anyhow  Beachy Bill has developed 4 or 5 brothers  lately, & we get a few extra shells daily -  but practically no material damage is done.  This is an absolutely 'newsless' letter - but  better luck next time. Tip top as usual. 
Rollo.
