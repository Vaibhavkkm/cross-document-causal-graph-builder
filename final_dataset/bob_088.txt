 My dear Mum, Arrived at our base here last Thursday afternoon after a very pleasant trip across from England except we had to march from Boulogne to here a distance of 18 miles still it was a beautiful day and I had nothing to carry having sent my gear on by lorry stood the march a treat of course very tired but the night before at Boulogne was a bit of a night out for me so that one was lucky to get through just feeling tired Have done nothing here yet - so a except rest and kick around so am quite recovered now Am leaving here tomorrow to join the battalion do not know excatily where they are but
believe they are out of the front line at present it just feels  like going home to me shall be right glad to join them up again Have been having quite a good time here meeting a number of the old hands from the battalion I have not seen for months C Major Twynan Capt Henry Capt Mosely all of the 13th are on their way back then I know the C.O. Major Clayton Jack Kirkwood and many other officers who are here from the 4th Brigade and 4th Division it is great seeing all these chap s one is interested in again we have had great yarns Had quite a good day yesterday g got up at 11 o'clock then with Major Twynan Capt Henry and Lt. Webster the Adj. here went into Etaples where we 
had a specially ordered and French cooked lunch it was purely French and very good indeed no good me trying to telling you what we had for I cannot  pronounce or spell the names given to the dishes we also washed it all down with 2 large bottles of Fizz which went very well after lunch or breafast as they call it here we all went out to Paris Plage a seaside resort about ½ an hour in the train from Etaples It is a very pretty place with a nice long beach and in summer should be great for swimming and French lasses We had a good look around brought some sweets sat on the beach and ate them arrived back in camp about 6 o'clock after tea we went to a concert 
 in the camp given by the Maries it was excellent the war cry s etc being weird and good. After the concert we returned to the mess had several drinks then turned into bed Instead of going to church this morning went into Etaples to the Officers Club where I had a lovely hot bath Am writing letters this afternoon also a wee sleep I think will be if order if nothing more exciting turns up  It is voting day to-day see Bruce Smith is still going strong shall give him my vote but fear the Australian politics are very foreign to me at present. The weather here at present is simply glorious very like Australian Spring and looks as if it may continue for a few months now it is hard to imagine 
the extremes as far as the weather is concerned on this side of the world. It will be quite a pleasure to fight and die if need be under climatic conditions such as exist at present. Have heard no word from Nana for a long time but expect you will be getting regular mail from him while he is in England.  Shall drop you a line as soon as I join up the battalion which should be about next Tuesday lots of love to all, Bob.
