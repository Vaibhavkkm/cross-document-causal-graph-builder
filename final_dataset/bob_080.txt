My dear Mum, Have been having a bad time at the dentist with my mouth all the past week going to him every day and sometimes twice per day Have a weeks extension leave so that I can get this trouble fixed up before going back so that I shall not be leaving London now until the 19th of  this month instead of the 12th sounds all right of course but it does not suit me am running short of cash also another dentists bill to pay besides am keen to get back to work again now. Of course am making the most of my last few days here having a real good time.  McKillop one of our officers came in and pulled me out of bed at 11.45 this morning but of course a late Saturday night will easily account for that brought him over here to the club picked up a couple of other chaps we have just returned from lunch and it was some lunch went to a place in Oxford St where they have a splendid rag-time band.  Message here for me from Kell he has been chasing me all day expect I shall pick him up before mid night some where. he is still in hospital but doing very well.  Received some letters a couple of days ago one from you one from Jane one from Mick one from Lorna dated about end of Dec & 1st week Jan.  Jolly glad to have them first Australian news I have had for weeks.  Sorry you have not received your parcel from Liberties yet still perhaps you have hardly had time up to 6th January 1917 did not purchase it until 14th Nov so that expect you must allow 2 months or so trust it comes along eventually. lots of love to all, Bob.
