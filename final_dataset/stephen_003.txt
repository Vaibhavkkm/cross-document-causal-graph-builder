 Dear Flo Turn over  Just a few lines to let you know that I received  your welcome letter yesterday and was glad to hear from  you we are having a fairly good time here in france but  Judging by the row that the guns make and the hum of  shells and bullets I am beginning to realise that there is a  war on somewhere about here and if they do not stop  throwing bits of lead about and small Iron foundries  at one another I really think somebody will surely get  hurt your letter found me in my little dugout in the  trench we are having a good time and have plenty of  company expesially of a night time the rats come and  kiss us good night and run about over us just as  though we were a public roadway here for their  especial benefit to play with while a guard one night  I passed a bit of the time away trying to Bayonet them  but could not get any of them they were to quick for  me also to cunning I have not received the parcel  that you sent yet I will let you know as soon as I get  it Bob is not back yet but will be with the Batt  in a couple of weeks time I had a letter from him  a few days ago and he said that he is with the  first Batch to reinforce so I hope to see him
