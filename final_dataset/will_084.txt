DOMINION OF NEW ZEALAND        PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE Savoy Hotel, London. 9th May, 1917.    Dear General Birdwood: Very many thanks for your letter of the 5th inst  which I have received today. One of the regrets I feel   in leaving England is that time has not permitted of my paying  another visit to France to see our brave boys who will, in  all probability be hard at it again in the firing zone in the  near future. Had I had an opportunity of coming over I should   have had a very great pleasure in paying you a visit. However,   it is impossible owing to the shortness of time which remains   until my setting out on my homeward journey.  I am delighted to read of the success of the  Australians, and I know that you will always look back with  pride to your association with the gallant lads of Australia   and from our own Dominion, in this great War.  With all good wishes to yourself, and kindest   regards.  Believe me,  Yours sincerely:  W.J. Massey
