My Dear Mum & family,  Saturday 21st. August 1915, Not much news for you yet but just a line to let you know everything is all right & we are all a happy family. The food on board is excellent plenty of  butter etc Porridge, meat & rolls for breakfast Soup meat and pudding for  dinner & mea cold meat pickles etc for tea. Corporals have a special mess of our company also have a special supper every night by tipping the cook fish & chips chicken etc etc so you see life on board ship is indeed a paradise after Liverpool. A great many of the chaps were very sick yesterday & some have not yet recoved although the sea is like glass to-day. Hare is OK he will write. Do not know our first port of call Will write again soon. Love  Bob.
