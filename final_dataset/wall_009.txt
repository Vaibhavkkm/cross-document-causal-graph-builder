Gallipoli Peninsula Cheshire Ridge October 28th, 1915.  Dear Mum, A few more lines to let you know  I am still alive & kicking & am in good  health & I hope you are all the same at home  I haven't heard from you for about a fortnight  now but I expect to hear shortly as the mail  comes in, in a couple of days. Things are  fairly quiet here & I expect they will be till after  the Winter & then I suppose we will be  relieved & I think we will need to be if what  the official news says is true that is we have  it fairly warm, with occassional cold snap of  a night time & I can tell you it is cold snap. I  think I spent the coldest night I ever spent  the time before last that we were in the trenches  we were tramping up & down with overcoats on &   warm clothing & we were shivering like leafs, but  still that is not the worst the Winter starts about  the middle of January & there is to be cold snow  blizzards for 7 days without stopping & the snow  is on the ground for over 6 weeks. I have had  a go at the Patrols & I like it just the thing it is
a bit livelier than in the Trenches. I wanted to get  it permanent but I don't think our O.C. I will  allow me to, he won't give me any chance to  get a commission & he won't let me get out of the   Coy, so don't be surprised if I through up/stripe  for a while to get out of it. I have been in charge  of the platoon ever since I came to Gallipoli  & pretty well since I came from Australia I  can tell you it doesn't put much heart in you  if you see other Sgts a lot junior to you, put  over you & I can tell you it does make you want  to get out of the rotten Coy. But I suppose  everything comes to those that wait & I think  I will show them a point or two. Otherwise I am  having a fair time. The Turks gave us a bit  of a bombardment the other day. But we were  in the Trenches & didn't get hit but out the back of them in the   Tren Gully there was a good few got hit there was  six killed & a good few wounded. I hope you are  taking as much money as you want because you   I have told you enough times to & buy yourself  & Blanche something for yourself for Christmas  I must close now in with love to all from, Wally
