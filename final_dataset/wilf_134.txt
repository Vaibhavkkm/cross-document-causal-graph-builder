 CAIRO, Egypt, December 25th 1918.   My dear mother, Just a few lines with a scratchy pen to say that I have come to Cairo to await embarkation to Australia. I thought I was to go on a boat which leaves tomorrow but luck is not with  me & I am to wait for the next lot probably another month. I'm very disappointed but it's no use grumbling. I'm having a quiet Xmas - Cairo isn't a very good  place to spend it, as there are really no decent amusements at all. When I come home I'm anxious to get into one of the hospitals again for a while to rub up my work  again & it's most  important to get back early or all the places will be taken by others returning. I hope you are keeping well my dear & not too disappointed because I am not with you this Xmas as you had hoped. However only a short period to wait now my dear & all should be well. Lots of love & all sorts of good wishes for the New Year from Your loving son Wilf
