November 14,1917   My dear General, This is just a short line to offer you my heartiest congratulations on your promotion. It differs, I am sure, from any other " recognition of brilliant services to the
country" in that it will  cause satisfaction and pride not only to the recipient, but also to tens of thousands of men whose soul he is. You know now deeply I am devoted to you, so there is no need for me to tell you that I feel exactly as happy about it as any man serving under you.  News from Russia is still conflicting. One  thing is certain - that this is the last phase of  treasonable indecision and imbecility on the part of the Government. The one question which is causing me intense apprehension is the  stability of the Russo - Roumanian front. An enemy success in that 
region would be a real calamity not only to Roumania and Russia, but to the Alliance, as it would give Germany an early access to the granary of Russia. With best wishes and sincerest regards Yours ever, Nabokoff
