Wednesday   Sept. 23rd
A very restless night, the beds 
seems as hard as ever. The Light Horse Section of the Ambulance struck camp this morning and have gone on board. Our instructors are very weak and our squads slowly getting harder to work, so that  the whole business is irritating & damn  hard work. Leave from 2.30 to 12 p.m. I saw Joe Neilson, Joe Davis, Harry Early, Oldham
& McDowell in the after-noon and went over to Manly returning by the  9.45 boat
The tent was very noisy to-night Heady makes a hell of a nuisance of himselves in his drunken state.
