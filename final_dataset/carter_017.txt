5th May, 1915 My Dear Father & Mother Things are a bit milder in the trenches but nevertheless the war game is not what its cracked up to be. - - It's pretty easy to hear of a lot of one's friends getting knocked out - You will have seen the casualty list by now. I don't mind the hardships a bit. Just now we are sleeping - or trying to sleep - on the edge of the mountains; if we roll in our sleep we may roll farther than bargained. I have not had my clothes off for nearly a week. - I've now got used to noise - can sleep most soundley thro' a rattling fusillade
