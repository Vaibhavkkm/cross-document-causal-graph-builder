Sunday 25th April 1915   After a pleasant  voyage- boat arrived off   Fremantle at 9a.m. Church service held  at 11a.m by Chaplain Chalmers. Yachts  pleasure boats etc - came around boat  in afternoon. Saw Uncle Will. on board one  of the tugs - arranged to see him somehow  next day. Officers detailed for sentry -go  during the night - somewhat extraordinary   Monday April 26th 1915. Up early - boat towed into Fremantle Harbour -  - spent a good hour watching Fremantle   through glasses. On At 9.45 - Uncle Will  came aboard - (I think through the courtesy of  Major Peters) - with letters & parcels. All  very much appreciated. Had a good time.  Western Australian troops embarked at 11 a.m  Transport left Fremantle at 4p.m.  "R.M.S. Morea" a few minutes after -  both bound for Colombo. Fine send off  from the Westralians as we steamed out.  Serious trouble ahead - three of my  Sergeants charged with "conduct to the prejudice   of good order and military discipline".   Tuesday April. 27th 1915  Fine weather - but gradually getting among  the true ocean rollers - grand sailing   indeed. The cases against the N.C.O's adjourned  by the Major because they had not been  previously investigated by their company  commander (King's Regs. 484). Officer of the  Guard for today. Rifles well cleaned up  - signalling gradually progressing.  Handed over the 10th to the Westralians.
