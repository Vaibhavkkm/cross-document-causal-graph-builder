November 28th.  Tuesday. Letters to hand from Reynolds and Gwen Timbury, Xmas cards from Blaxland and Gifford. It was jolly fine of Gwen to write so pleasantly on getting my address from Dave Christie. She makes quite a good fist of letter writing. Winzar is such an infernal talking machine that there is no peace of mind for writing and I badly want to get some done as there are good stories going begging.
