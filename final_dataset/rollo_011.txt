Text:  I have a sort of feeling that this part won't last much longer - but I sincerely hope to be well in at the 'kill' - I want to avenge Gordon Munro - I have not yet had the close quarter opportunity - but if God permits - when I do - I will show I have not forgotten – I will do my best to give my little bit in helping to blot out the remembrance of Belgium, Serbia, & Gallipoli. Love to all - & best of good wishes &c Rollo
