No 2. General. Hospital Gheyireh Palace, Cairo. 26. 01. 1916.
 My dear Miss Champion, I do remember Private Tom Whyte very well. The poor man came on the Gaseon during the morning. He had an abdominal wound, and was taken to the operation room almost at once. and every thing possible was done for him. He was very anxious that a packet should be given to a friend of his. whose name I have unfortunately forgotten. Late that night I went to the poor man and stayed with him til he died - Really I don't think he suffered very much pain, but was glad to have some woman there, he died between 12 m.n. and 1 a.m. I was with him at the time & for some time before. The only thing he was worried over was some package being delivered to his friend, & I'm fairly certain it was sent. 
The Colonel was very good & did his best to carry out such requests. I feel certain that there must have been some message for you in it. He was a brave man and died as a man ought. I'm more sorry for you than I can tell you - and it was knowing he was engaged made me stay on duty a little longer. to be what comfort I could to him. It was a terrible day for us all and I saw so much that  
was awful that Day. I'm sorry I can't tell you more poor girl, but I would be only too thankful to answer any questions. The package was sewn up. and he did not as far as I know see any Photograph but I'm sure it was what he was so anxious about. You may rest he did not suffer very long and was not disfigured in any way. and I was with him to the very last I wish I could tell you more poor girl. Yours sincerely Katherine M. Porter
