Cortoon 24th February, 1915.  My dear old boy Just a word or two for as usual mail night & several to write. I wonder what you will think of Leo enlisting I wish you were together.  I cannot realize he has gone into camp. Linda feels keenly Leo's going but she & Eileen might comfort each other and we must be brave  and not shirk our duty helping each  other all we can during this terrible war. We are taking care of your goods also Leo's & Georges we have your book case & chairs in the little front room your chest drawers in Jacks. Oh how We will yearn for you & Leo to come home. Now dear goodnight God bless you Mother
