Mena Camp  3/1/1915 
 My Dear Father & Mother.  The New Year passed without much to mark it.  - - We have been doing a good deal of trench digging  this week - & the men worked at it with a will.  We built some of the latest type - they are peculiar to   relate almost the simplest trench possible.  - Sir George  Reid has been out to see us - - Church Parade   today - the Dean was much better; he is barracked with  the 3rd Battalion & they are bringing him up the way he should  go. If he makes any slip - or preaches for 1 second over  10 minutes he has to stand drinks for the mess.  This afternoon McKenzie & I went for a ride - we went  about 5 miles through a large palm plantation &  came upon quite a large Arab village (Kerdōsa),  all stone & sand huts with straw roofs. - We got into  the middle of it somehow & had quite a job getting out -  the horses shy at all the camels - Children &  native's all swarm round you for 'back sheesh'.  We could only get rid of them by galloping off.  It would be quite impossible for an ordinary civilian  to go there safely. I don't think I'd go in again  unarmed.
