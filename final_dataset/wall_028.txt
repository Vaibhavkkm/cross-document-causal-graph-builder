Perham Downs  July 18th 1916   Dear Mum  Well old Lady In hope this   finds you quite well & I can assure   you that I am. I am in England &   I will most likely have wired you  for some money as one does run   through a bit here. We have not   started our school here yet & I don't   just know when we will be doing so.   I have seen Blanche & Frank & my   word Blanche looks real well & they   both seem as happy as Larry. They are   living at quite a nice place. I think they   are shifting shortly as they are not satisfied   with their place.  They say that their   old landlady is very troublesome. Do not   alter the address on your letters as  I suppose  I will be back there again by the time you   could have received this & wrote back again.   Mum if I am lucky I may get my commission   this time in fact if we pass our exams we   will get it before we leave England. My   word won't I swank them with my star.
up & I expect Grandfather & Grandma will   be pleased also because I know Grandfather   likes to know how one is getting on. I am   going to write to Everill with this mail.   By jove London is a big place. But I don't   think it is so great a thing as some rave   about. I have seen a good few places. I went   to a service in St Paul's with Blanche &   Frank. I saw the church they were   married in & I have seen the Tower &   Big Ben. But you here them talk about   the traffic in England London I haven't seen   anything to write home about yet.   There are some jolly fine girls in   London though, but don't tell Ev about   them or I will be getting told about it.  Well I hope Bob & Jack are doing well &   I also hope that Dad & yourself are well   as I must close with love to all   especially yourself from.  your Loving Son,  Wall xxxxx
