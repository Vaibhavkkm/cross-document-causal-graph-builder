in No 4  Platoon Mickey Smith will  probably be transferred to a position  on Brigade Headquarters which Lieut  Holmes got for him recommended him for.  I don't know exactly what it is but at anyrate he will  be pleased to get out of Beevors clutch.  I think you know we arranged to keep  together & not take any non como position  but only commissions if offered.  Of  course this thing the 5 of us put in for  broke all that up so Phil & Mickey were  free to put in for their positions.    A couple of photos were taken to-day  & if they are any good I will try & get  copies for you.  I expect there will be  plenty in the S.A. papers about the match  to-day as Rhodes Du Rieu & the others  have all been writing long accounts of  it some of which are sure to find their  way into the papers.  You will have to be satisfied with a  short letter this week as there seems  to be a lack of news & as I want to  write several more letters to-night.  Everything is all right darling.  I still  think of you all day long.  The evenings  are the best as when I am lying in bed.  I always smoke a cigarette and think hard of  you.  Good night my darling angel.  Yours for-  ever  Tom
