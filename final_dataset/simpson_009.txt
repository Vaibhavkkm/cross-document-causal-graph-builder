 20.12.1914   Dear Mother  Just a line to let you know  that we arrived in Cairo last   week. We were 42 days on the  trip and we had a very fine  trip right through We are   camped about ten mile out of  Cairo at the entrance of the  desert you can see nothing  but sand, sand, sand. We  have got two pyramids about  3 hundreds yards from our  tents it is a terrible long  climb to the top of one of   the pyramids There is 100   thousand troops in this   camp that is with English  troops and Indians They are  expecting the Turks to   advance on Cairo they are  building a light railway  across the desert to reach  Cairo, I wish that they would hurry  up and come for every body  is getting impatient to have  a brush up with the Turks  I am afraid that when they do  come they will get a pretty hot  reception. when they do come  they will find every thing ready  for them. Now Mother from the  25 of October you should have been  drawing 2/- per day I am getting  6 shillings per day 5 shillings per  day and one shilling deferred pay  and I am drawing 1 shilling per  day for pocket money and I am  leaving you two shillings per day  to you and I am having two  shillings per day to my account  in the Commonwealth Bank in  London. The grub in this camp  in very bad. We have to buy  nearly as much as they you  would think that they were  feeding a lot of sparrows 
instead of hungry men Now   Mother, I hope that you and   Annie are keeping well for I   am keeping in the best of health  It will soon be Xmas and  a pretty miserable Xmas here  by the looks of things Now  Mother I think that I will  now draw to a close hopeing  that this will find you and  Annie in the best of health  and with Love to you and  Annie  I remain  Your Loving Son  Jack  P.S.  My address is  Private Jack Simpson  C Section   3rd Field Ambulance  Australian Army Medical Core  Mena Camp Cairo
