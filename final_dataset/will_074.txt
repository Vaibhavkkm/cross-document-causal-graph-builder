Intelligence Anglaise 27 Place du Marche St Honoré  Paris  27. March 1917     My dear General.  I am much touched,  Nothing could have given  me greater pleasure than  your letter which I found  on my return from I.H.Q  last night.  K talked so much about you  always using your pet name  that I seem to know you well.  Two days ago I was at  Bapaume. Next time I
hope you will let me   call and see you!!  I will come up from the  Chief's with Heseltine or  somebody.  Yes. our people have been   very mean about K,  rending his great name  to suit their petty  political exigencies.  However, he lies peacefully   at the bottom of the
seas, unheeding these jackals.  No one who knew the  official K could realise   the tones of his voice  when he spoke of a friend   like you.  No one, among his  colleagues, realised that  he had no axe to  grind, and cared for  nothing except to see   England victorious.  It is right and proper
that he should be made a   scape goat for men who   have an eye on "honours"   or their pockets.  It is all in this great tradition   of heroes and martyrs.  I was very much attached to   him and to Fitz,   and I hope, then soon I  am again with D.H.  to have a talk with you   again, many thanks.  Yours most sincerely,  G. Sher
