1700 lecture Fire Discipline and Controle by Capt. G. G. Campbell. Major Harris in his lecture stated that he thought it best to number the Sectons in each Platoon respectively 1.2.3.4. Anybody might get into complications with the present system of numbering sections up to 16 as at present in this new scheme of trench attack. "Moppers Up" will make the third line advancing in fairly close formation instead of being scattered about more so as their work necessitated their bunching together at the commencement of their duty in cleaning up a trench. Moppers up may be drawn from another Platoon if the attack is for 2 Platoon. If a Company is in attack the "Moppers Up" may be drawn from a different Company but they may also be drawn from the Company's own strength. The advancing formation and the "Jumping Off" trench formation remain very much the same as in the attack practiced early in the term with the acception that the first section of each Platoon are riflemen, The 2nd. Rifle Graniders 3rd. Bombers 4th section Lewis Gun. We practiced two systems of getting out rapidly from the trench into formation. Firstly, be keeping the sections together in the trench as per diagram and then by spliting the sections up and placing the men in the direct front they will advance over. viz. men from 1.2.3.4. sections taking their position alternatly. This latter system was not generally favoured.

"Fire Discipline and Controle." By Capt. G. G. Campbell. The essential points come under three headings. 1st. Fire Direction 2nd.  "   Controle 3rd.   "    Discipline. These three essentials have been time and again impressed upon us by Army so we have endeavoured to instill this into you Officers and N.C.O.s in our Musketry and Range drill. General Gough of the 5th Army wants better efficency in the use of the rifle. The rifle is a powerful and accurate weapon and so men have to be skilled in its use or its efficency is greatly reduced. There is no set standard on maximm as to the users ability to make it accurate. It is not a matter of pushing five rounds into the magazine and getting bulls eyes, even, there must be controle and Direction. Fire may be directed from Coy. Commands down through the whole company where the section commanders are left to see that it is done correctly and properly. Controle of fire will be Platoon commanders duty. To have perfect controle it would be possible to turn on fire as though it were a hose being switched about. If fire is opened too early it fails in its objective. The moral effect of a sudden burst of fire on the enemy will be great. Be carefull not the expend ammunition unduely. There are two kinds of fire "Rapid" and "Deliberate". Rapid fire should be held in reserve as long as possible for especial targets Visual training for Secton commanders. In giving orders under fire always use the same terms as the men are accustomed on the parade ground men will easily understand. To get good fire discipline men must be well and carefully taught on the parade ground. Observation of the enemy by keeping the eye alway fixed upon him while loading or handling the rifle. 70% of shots have been found to be wasted chiefly by firing at wrong target and faulty ranging. For further details 115 to 117.
