Dear Harry,  Sometime since I wrote to you - but I've been  rather busy lately. So you want to go to the Sch of Mines -  Don't - if I were you I'd work hard for Jervis B or Duntroon.  How are you getting on - in IV now ? Time you were  making a mark in football or cricket - so go hard at  these games now. This is a pretty country - & with green  grass & ripening wheat everywhere it looks fine now.  Women do all the work - no men except very old ones about.  These are fine 'dogs' in this village - trained to pull carts.  work churns &c. as well as to watch cows & sheep. To work  the churn the dog is put on a big round box fastened to  an axle which works the churn by cogs. The dog has to  keep walking - & thus turning the wheel until he gets very  tired. Look after dad & Mum receive love & best  wishes from your brother  Rollo
