My dear Mum, Arrived back with the Battn last Saturday night from La Motte we are close to the line doing fatigue work which is all right except we are working under shell fire and usually lose a few men each day. The Colonel and Capt Murray have been very decent to me will not let me go and do anything except play cricket want me to rest the leg and have a  good spell while we have the chance. We are leading for the cricket cup having a good game against the 4th Field Ambulance yesterday whom we beat by 20 runs with ten minutes  to go  started at 4-30PM and finished at 8-20PM when it was quite light if we meet the 16th Battn next Wednesday if not in the line again by that time. It is indeed funny
and most exciting playing cricket with guns going off and shells flying unpleasantly close at times. Humphrey Browning is back again with the Battn and several other officers so we are fairly well off in that respect at present. No doubt lots of us will go shortly we expect a lot of heavy work in the near future wonder if ever this awful business is going to stop. Harry  Murray saw Len while he was across in England visiting the Henley's at the Windsor Hotel told me he was OK had his star up and I guess swanking in London generally unfortunately expect he will be across here again shortly hope to goodness his luck sticks to him Toby Bartons brother who has just received his commission and rejoined the 45th was killed in the last stunt isn't it rotten for his mother both boys gone now. Well I have to  go and get the team practicing for the next match also a lot of letters to censor also some bridge to play everyone is back  from work having started at 3 am this  morning best love to all Bob Bad luck missing my last mail  it has been sent on to England but hope some comes back eventually
