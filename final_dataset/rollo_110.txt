 Dear Father & Mother, -  You will have to excuse a very brief note today; - we are exceedingly busy- never an hour to ourselves - getting ready for the "Spring". A mixture of news today - We have got Bapaume, Achet le Petit, le Transloy, & now the Russian Revolution which we hope will better our position  On the other hand we hear rumors of a German push in Belgium. I hope we get a look in before things finish down here. for I am keen on having a look at historic Cambrai. Mesopotamia news too is splendid - the tail of the British Line getting stiffer and stiffer -   & is rising gradually to perpendicular. My name has gone in for my Majority - but I hope it does not come thru yet. - I feel too young  &inexperienced.. No more news - plenty of work. Hope your birthday Dad is still going strong. Very best of all good wishes &much love to all, especially yourselves, from  Your loving son, Rollo.
