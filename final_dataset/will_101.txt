In the field. November 17, 1917.  To General Birdwood. Com, A.I.F. France   Sir During the time I have been in the field, I have noticed the enormous wastage in shells &c through failure of detonation.  I am a mechanic and have designed a devise which will eliminate that trouble.  Being well aware that the solving of this problem has received and is still receiving the attention of military experts apparently without success I still have every confidence 
of being able to produce a simple mechanism which will bring about perfect detonation in all percussion projectiles. I feel justified in communicating this matter direct to you as a means of placing my services at the disposal of the ordnance department, at the earliest possible moment.  Sir,  I beg to remain   Yours obediently  6314, Spr.  Greenwald,  4th Field Coy.,  Australian Engineers.  9am or 12 noon tomorrow
