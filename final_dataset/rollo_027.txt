Sheets came on by an earlier train but we didn't get  them so we men slept in our clothes.  I had to prowl around  to find Medical Tent - to get Pte (Cumberland) fixed up - but  it took me 1½ hours.  Then we had to hunt around for the  blankets & W.P. getting the former up just at daybreak.  We got no sleep that night- commenced work at 6 am 20th  went to Cairo in afternoon - & returned here at 10pm.  I  fell asleep in my clothes - no sleep since Reveille 19th.  I was to have gone with Hancock & Ireland to Pyr. today  but was I was too tired, stayed in camp, wrote home.  Expect to be at front when you get this - much love &  best wishes - birthday greetings to Harry - hope you're in  the same tip-top health as I am.  Camp Hours.
