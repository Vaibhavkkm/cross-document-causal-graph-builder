10. 10. 1918. My dear mother, I haven't written you a line since operations commenced, simply because I have been too busy & now I just want to scratch you a small note to say that I am well & everything is O.K. This is written from Damascus which sounds rather romantic but I'm very disappointed with the famous city as I find it a beastly dirty, not to say verminous city. We have had a wonderful experience this time - talk of prisoners I'm fed up with the sight of them we have taken so many. One lot of about 15000 marched nearly 100 miles to get away from us & we caught them in Damascus just about half dead they had walked & walked practically without food & were just about dropping & didn't offer any resistance at all. I will settle 
down later & tell you all about my experiences but I'm rather tired tonight & just wanted to write you a small scrawl. Jack is quite a long way from me at present - haven't seen him at all during operations. I haven't had any news of that boat & my trip home just yet - we are all too busy now. At any rate it was a good stunt to have been on & I hope a good one to finish up with as I want to get home & see you now. Lots of love & hugs from Your loving son, Wilf.
