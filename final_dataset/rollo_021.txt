Tuesday 20th April 1915  After no sleep - men also out all night - granted General Leave - got up at 6. A.M. Immediately get to work to get ready to move.  After a bit of bother - prisoner etc got out of camp at 1 pm with all except three deserters - Everett- Nelson & McVea - march out of camp- most enthusiastic - had to force way out -  cheers from all. On Mitcham Station - complimented by the Major for the way my boys had carried on. This was most gratifying.  Enthusiasm shown all along the line - especially main street in Pt Adelaide.  Reached the Harbour & immediately  set about getting men out to the Hororata by means of launches. “Tim on the troop deck”. - Ship sailed at about 8p.m - too busy to go up on deck except to see the lights  of Brighton. Beautiful weather - spring every where on land green showing every where - calm sea - gave us a very fine departure. The conduct of the men most excellent - two or three bits of trouble - but the bond of understanding between the men & myself seemed & did develop most considerably. At 10.30p.m after many hard days toil am I writing this - after having read two most holy farewell letters from home. I pray to God that we will all be spared to meet again in a few months time.  Bema on the wharf to see me go - just got down in time. Was last to leave shore & last to board the boat. Am very very tired & contented with everything - thoughts are beautiful - so I will now give way to thoughts of home.
Rollo.

Wednesday 21st April 1915. After a good nights rest got up at 6 a.m - wondered why reveille had not been sounded - forgot about clock time being put back 1/2 an hour men settled down very well - a few sea sick  a beautiful day - no land in sight anywhere
