Dear Mother & Father,
 As you see by the address I have joined my battalion at last. At present we are billeted behind the lines as Reserves, and are to go into the trenches shortly.  Several of my mates came into the same company, so I am feeling quite at home, and not out of place, as I
thought I should for some time.
 We have been doing fatigue work in reserve trenches, building dugouts &e., rising at 3 am. and returning about 11.30 am. The work is a change from 10 weeks in the training camp although it is by no means easy.
 I have not got any letters since I last wrote. There was a mail in here last night, but I suppose mine have been returned to my reinforcements,
 When you write, address my letters as above :- No.  Name
A Company
21st Battalion A.I.F. France

I have had a few more letters from L[[?]]. He tells me you have received some of my letters from Egypt - as well as the diary. I was glad to hear they came to hand alright. I have sent some more to Les in London. He will probably post it to you.  He has been through a machine- gun course and a grenade course since he returned to duty. In his last letter (2/6/16), he had not heard anything definite about coming across.
 It is 10 weeks since your last letter so I am looking forward to them
shortly.
I have not much to tell you
this time, and the censorship, from
all accounts, is more strict than
before. Tell Ruby and Gertie I
have no time to write to them this time.
I am scribbling this in a hurry to
catch the mail.
Your affectionate son,
Jim.
