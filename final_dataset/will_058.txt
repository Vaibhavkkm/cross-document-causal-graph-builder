19.1.1917  GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,  BRITISH ARMIES IN FRANCE.     My dear General,  Many thanks for yours  of 17th. I will come & see   you when you are settled  in your new quarters. At   present with Vessy away &  the new man not arrived  I am rather tied by the leg.  (Vessy has been dangerously   ill pneumonia now convalescent  but has to go home for two months)  About the pick up Gazette I have  ventured to write to M.S that I
thought omission of your  name would be badly received  in Australia.  I am writing to try to have  Maclagan's name be considered  for a C.B. but they cut out   nearly all Brigadiers for  CB's & gave them CMGs, as a  matter of fact we did not put   up Maclagan, they will probably  now give him K.C.M.G, but I have   recommended CB & said the original
omission of his name was a mistake  I think I can get Graham  to alter Gellibrand to CMGs  as under the circumstances  you mention a brevet majority  is a somewhat empty honor.  As regards White his promotion  was the outcome of the chief's  re commendations for M.G in the  Dominion Forces Australia  refused then but conceded the  A.I.F promotion  Yours always,  WE Peyton
