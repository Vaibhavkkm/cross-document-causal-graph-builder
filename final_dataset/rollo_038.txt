Text:

  I have a fine old Sergeant - (Don Chisholme)  with me - an old Cameron Highlander (79th) - & he went  through Egypt & S. African campaigns. He has  been wounded twice already, but is back, & looking  for more. He is a fine old soldier, & with his aid I  am getting up a fine platoon.  'Jacko' has begun throwing 'liquid' bombs at  us - & he has gas too. We are ready with gas  helmets - but devil a bit of gas to reply with.  I doubt if this will pass the censor - I could  tell you much more if I liked to risk it - but  it must remain untold for some time. With the help  of my letters (if you keep them) I will be able to  patch up a full account of everything.
