11/11/1916,  France, 
 Darling Mother  Am snatching a  few spare minutes to scratch  a line or two.  I am "O.K."  but have very little time  to myself owing to the bad  state of the country. When I  tell you it takes 15 hours to  get rations up to the line &  then only on pack horses you  will be able to form some  idea of the difficulties; I am  thankful to say that up  to the present we haven't  failed the boys & you can bet  your bottom dollar that we wont  unless we all get wiped out  & thats not likely to happen.  Mails are very irregular  just now princibly through the
inclement weather. Haven't had  any for some days. Last was  from Jennie & yourself, both of which  arrived together. Haven't seen anything  of Mr Hooper since his return  but from what I hear I believe  he has fallen in love with you.  Can give you no news   as its very scarce.  Please give my fondest love  to Dad & Jennie & heaps for yourself  Good night God bless  & guard you all  Ever your loving Son,  Ernie.
