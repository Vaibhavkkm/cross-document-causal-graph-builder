12. 2. 1917  GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,  BRITISH ARMIES IN FRANCE.  My Dear General   I am sorry indeed about  your bad luck, but a little   holiday in the South of  France will not be a bad  thing for you in every way &  change of scene & a rest for  mind & body. I hope you will  be able to get Lady Birdie  out. Old Nick was making  anxious enquiries for you the   day I was over at the Dardanelles
Commission "Can you explain to"  "the General Birdwood's reluctance"  "to come & see us". I said in wire  all reluctant, this was not at  the Commission but during lunch.  I think there has been a good deal  of lying going on & some quite  unfounded allegations  regarding the character & Not at all well &has been in hospital for  a couple of weeks & is still there..  He had a bad attack of gastritis but is  now on the mend.  I trust, dear General that you will continue to  gain ground and add more laurels to the  fame of Anzac. as you have already done  in France under conditions, we here in Egypt  can but scarcely appreciate.  Thanking you heartily for your kindness in  remembering me at such a time and in  the midst of your great work.  I am  Yours very sincerely, W P Farr.
