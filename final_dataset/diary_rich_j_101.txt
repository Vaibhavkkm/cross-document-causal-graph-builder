March 7th.    Wednesday. Parade with rifles on the old Roman camp suit. A Cockney Sergeant gave us a hard, but good time at physical exercises. He never lagged at all, and yet kept us going hard the whole time. I will follow his course closely. Rifle exerciese by our instructor, Capt. Maltby followed physical drill. One point, that of closing the pouch after taking a clip of cartridges out is done after the loading in completed not immediately after the clip is taken out, as A. Coy. were taught to do. I learnt a lot of good information this morning even if I did blunder over the "slope" "present" and others a little. There was a cold wind blowing making the fingers very stiff. Afternoon was given over to a football match, Victorian code of game, The Cadets played and beat the Officers by a large score 6 goals to 2 goals. The lecture on Aeroplane Co-operation for 5 p.m. did not take place.
