20.3.17  GENERAL HEADQUARTERS,  BRITISH ARMIES IN FRANCE.     My dear General  I think matters are  turning too much just   at present for me to   make any long talked of   visit. I dont suppose   you will be able to remain   where you are very long.   I have had the schedules   looked up nothing ever came  in for Durnford, the other
Chaplain who was on the same   Sheet in your copy came in   to us on a sheet by himself.  All good luck to you. The  situation is very interesting & I   am afraid for the troops attendant   with a good many difficulties   I wonder what the Boche really   means any way it is a great   thing to get him in the month
& if he intends an offensive into   the Divisions he has I believe   him foredoomed to failure.  I saw a telegram after it had   been sent (draft by G.S) to Australian Government   announcing that Baupaume   had fallen to the Australians  & winding up with the hope   that sufficient -re-inforcements   would be forthcoming from   Australia to enable their Corps'   to continue their brilliant   successes. Is there any difficulty   about reinforcements & was the
tone of the cable a wise one?  I rather thought not. I hope  Carruthers is standing the strain  allright. I was up with  Godley last Sunday.  Yours always  WE Peyton
