 1st Lieut  I wrote earlier but did not dare send it in view  of circumstances - but look up the papers of this date  et sequ. Just recd word that Hancock & I  have recd. our second stars - so are now full  blown Lieutenants.  I hope to write next week from elsewhere -  but this must suffice at present.  Good luck - best love.
