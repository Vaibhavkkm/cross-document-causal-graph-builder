In The Trenches Somewhere in France. May 17th 1916.  Dear Mum. Your letter to hand dated the 5th April. I was glad to hear that you were keeping well, well this leaves me this is leaving me the same. I have to tell you that this I have been recommended for a Commission again this is the second time now. I saw by your letter that Bob had been very foolish & got married slyly. Well mum I don't want you to worry too much about him, I know that you must feel it badly. but never mingd old girl. I don't know who told you that the girl was no good. but I am almost sure that they are wrong, because they Weatherall family is fairly respectable & the girl is alright. well at least as far as I know about her & I have spoken to her a couple of times & she always seemed very decent. & I think that Bob would be to blame perhaps more than she is. But at anyrate if old lady be sure & not worry too much about him & be sure that if you want to put him out do it by all means. But the thing that
hurts me is to think that he would go & do such a thing behind your back. Mum you be sure that if you want my money you can have it even if you take the whole lot. because you may need it more than I ever will. I hope Jack is keeping good to you & see that you go out a good bit. You I won't say anything to Blanche about it unless she says something first. I had a letter from Blanche when she landed in England, also a telegram a day before she got married. & I couldn't get over there to see her married & I was in the Trenches & couldn't wire to her wishing her the best of luck. Well I hope here married life will make her a bit fatter than she was than when she left you. I just received your letter tonight about Bob & it is now about 11 o clock & I am must go to bed. well good night mum & I hope you don't worry too much. Lots of Love and kisses from Your Loving Son, Wally. xxxxxxx
