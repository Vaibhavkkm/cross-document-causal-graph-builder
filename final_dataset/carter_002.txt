 I'm sitting on the desert sand with one of my trunks as a table. - There is some song about 'the desert sands never growing cold'. I'd like to bring the writer out here to sleep one night. In the early morning it seems to be almost freezing. The days are warm but so far mild and pleasant - it is really a far more suitable training ground than England would have been & besides we are within a mile from the Pyramids. We are camped in a large valley – just off the Nile Valley - on our right (Eastwards) is the fertile Nile valley, quite green & covered in places with dense palm growths. Westward the barren desert – to the South are the Pyramids. - - The Great Pyramid has been swarming with soldiery (afternoons are free) It's quite a stiff climb & already we've had an accident to a man in our batallion who fell from about ¾ the way up to the bottom. He will live, they think. but will have to be sent back to Australia.
