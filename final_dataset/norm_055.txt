 Dearest Mother, & all at Home, Well!  I have just returned from 4 days leave in London which I spent with May Tilton. I had some difficulty in getting away from camp thro' being in Isolation for being a contact of a case of Meningitis, developed by a sergeant in the 117th Battery who slept in the same hut as myself, & of course we were all put in strict isolation. The Dr was very considerate for me however, & sent me in on horseback to Sutton Veny Hospital to have a "swab" of my throat taken by the patheologist, & this was put in an incubator for 24 hours, & at the end of that time it proved "negative" & I was allowed to proceed on Leave. I caught a train from Codford at ten minutes past one on Monday, & on arrival at Salisbury, there was a fast train for Waterloo in ten minutes & this got me into London by 3-15 p.m. Altho' the distance is 85 miles, the train did not stop between Salisbury & Waterloo, & she travels at about 65 miles per hour, so we have something to catch up in Railway services in Melbourne, eh? I was to have met May at Euston at 2.30pm, but this was out of
reason, however I had sent her a telegram to this effect, & she went to her hotel. On my arrival, I went to the Strand Palace Hotel but May had gone to a Theatre with some other Nurses, so I left a note, & returned in the morning at 10-30, & met her waiting for me. She looked fine , — Never better, — & not a day older than when I last saw her, & as jolly as ever, too. We went down to dinner, — after a long chat, & then we went to a matinee. Home again for Tea, & out to a Theatre afterwards. We flew about everywhere, & talk about taxis, — well we were in 3 different taxis in 10 minutes. That is the honest truth. Next day, I went shopping in Regent St, & Oxford St with May & another nurse, & of course took me into all the ladies underclothing Depts, & I felt awfully embarrased, & imagined that every girl in "Selfridges" in Oxford St (one of the largest firms in London) was looking at me, — however, I came thro' the ordeal well, loaded up with parcels etc, & thrust into a taxi, & back again to the Strand. In the evening, I met Lucy Cole, & brought her along & introduced her to May, & we had a mighty feed, & off to a theatre in another Taxi. May & Lucy took very 
well to each other, or at least I thought so, & they each in turn told me that they liked each other. After the theatre, came supper, & then I got Lucy off Home, & when I returned to my Hotel, I counted my money, & I found I had exactly 10½d left, out of £4., but May came to the rescue with £3 & off we started again. Next morning, we both went to the A.I.F Headquarters in Horseferry Rd, & transacted some business, & then taxied back to dinner, & in the afternoon we sat & talked until it was time for us to return to our respective stations, there to catch the train back to our quarters. It was a jolly fine little holiday, & I was very pleased to have met May, & the next time I meet her, I hope to have more cash, as London just eats £. I was sorry that Jack could not get over from France, but Gallipoli men come first for leave, & Jack missed that stunt. Lucy Cole has just got a job at the war office & was starting next Friday.  She had to pass thro' a test of shorthand & Typewriting, & this she easily succeeded in doing, as she is well up in this work, having had previous experience. Lucy told me that Harriet was in bed with Influenza, but 
was well over it now. Lucy also told me that there were 2 letters at Gravesend, also a paper from Australia, but the parcel has not turned up to date yet. May Tilton told me that she had nursed Geo Johnson in Hospl in Egypt, but she could not make out what he was in there for. We are very busy now as there are horses coming in each day, & we are hard at work breaking them in. There are some very good horses among them, but most are out of veterinary Depots. The riding horses are out of the Reserve Cavalry Brigade, & there are some fine hacks amongst them.  I picked a fine "tat" for myself, & he will carry my weight very well. We are having a good deal of trouble with men breaking camp, & absent without leave, & the Major has been obliged to award 28 detention & cells to the culprits, in order to stop it. Men get their parents to send them money from Australia, & then they clear  out until it is spent. — We have to stop it some where. Well! I hope you are all well at Home. Give my love to all, I am in the best of health, Thanks! Much love from Your loving Son, Norman.
