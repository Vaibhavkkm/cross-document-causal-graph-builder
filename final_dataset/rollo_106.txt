Text:  Dear Father & Mother,-  We are to do another tour for  the next few days so I’ll not be able to write to you  for the next mail.  Not much news at all -  except I’ve  got word thro’ from Todd - (on leave in Eng)  that the Omrah arrives somewhere about the 1st week in  March- so I am still hopeful of meeting George  - as I get leave immediately on ‘coming out’.  A Sydney Mail (20.12.16) has  the photos of the break up of Naval College &   G. doesn’t show up in any of the photos.  Presumably he’s still in Sick Bay with his   bad jaw.  However I hope his jaw is O.K. now -  & that his eyesight has not been affected at all. This short letter must suffice  this time, but I will write again as soon as  possible.  I will close now with very,  very much love, & best of all good wishes for all  sorts of good luck, prosperity, &c - from  Your loving son,  Rollo.
