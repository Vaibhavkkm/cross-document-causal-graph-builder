Text:    Dear Mother  Just a line to let you know that we   are still at Cairo.  I got a letter from you  the other day and some papers I am  sorry to hear that the Germans got so  near to Shields but I dont think  that you have much to fear of any  thing of the sort occurring again for they  would get too hot a time from our  fleet for I suppose that they are  keeping an extra sharp lookout  for any of the German ships  that may chance another run   out of the Kiel Canal I see  that there was another of our ships  blown up in the channel  What   did the people at home think about  the Sydney sinking the Emden  The Sydney belonged to the Austr  alian Navy and she was escorting  the first contingent from Australia  to Columbo with five more   Australian warships when she 
left us one morning and when  we  came in sight again the   next day we heard that she   had sunk the Emden I can  tell you that things were pretty  livly abouard all the ships in  the convoy there was 38 liners  transporting us to Egypt We had  a pretty lively time on the Medic  the day the Emden was sunk the  Medic was the transport that I  was on The old Colonel shouted  beer for all hands on bouard  and we all drank to the health  of the Sydney pretty deeply  I am afraid Now Mother I am  afraid that I cant give you any  more news as everything is the  same here So hoping that this will  find you and Annie will as it  leaves me at present so with love  to you and Annie.  I remain.  Your Loving Son,   Jack.
