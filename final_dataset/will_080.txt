17th April, 1917    My Dear Birdie.  I am very glad you think the  idea is a sound one- Your fellows   have had a very hard winter,_ harder  than most _ & ever since Feb 24th  they have had the lion's share of the  fighting _ There is a lot more before  us, & some of it will be of a very  serious type & your men are just the  lot to do great work then, if they are  decently fresh & rested, so I am sure  it will be a national asset if we  could give you even a few weeks  training & rest now-  I think we can manage it, but  perhaps it would be better not to wire to  Australia till we know  how the  situation pans out.  As things are at present, the VII  Corps & the III Army are hopelessly  sticky & God knows when they will  come on. I gather that the situation  has got very strained with G.H.Q.  & I should not wonder if one or  two gentlemen got a single ticket to  England soon !  Our attack on Sunday, at present,  seems likely to be even further postponed !!
If so, I think we would let you  put in the 11th Divn & get the  1st A.D. back.  I am thinking that directly the  attack is over (if Sunday, say  Monday or Tuesday) - your Staff  could drop back to Henencourt  & Fanshawe would take over the  whole line. The III Army  would releive both the 62nd in  Hendecourt, & Smythe in  Reincourt, & the latter would  go back & rejoin you -  Our next operation, would probably be an  attack towards Moeuvres or towards  Havrincourt, & in either case, a  couple of Divns would be all we  would employ. This could easily  be undertaken by the V Corps-  After that , as we advanced on  Cambrai, - you would come in  again. But I think it would  be pretty nearly 4 weeks before  all this would be done, which  would give you all a goodish  rest & change. These are only  ideas, but I hope they can be    carried out..  Yours ever.  HP Lynch
