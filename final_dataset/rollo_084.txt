Text:  Our Divvy is doing well – & we are still going strong – but a big stunt is just coming on and we are IT. We move right up tomorrow – and in five days' time I hope to give you all details of our stunt. The information we gather is that Fritz doesn't put up much of a personal fight (infantry anyhow) – unless they can do so without risk of getting hurt. The Artillery does all the fighting for them – and if we can only let our cavalry get loose - doubtless they too will up hands & "Kamerad"! The Australians seem a true type of British soldier – (judging by old standards) – some of the Pommy K. of K. lot are very so so – and one lot let one of our battalions down very badly the other day – but never again. I have seen a few of the old 10th., & some of old mates. Mattner & Carthew are here in tip top fettle , – Joe Blackett is 2 Lieut now, – but Dickinson is posted as missing – probably killed. His battn was being relieved, but seeing a casualty in another battn. he went across & dressed the wound, then disappeared . McKail was wounded – & back at a dressing station – told to walk to Ambulance - but instead went back to help his chums - & was killed going up. I have Dickin to avenge now. I will do my utmost, Love & best wishes, Rollo-
