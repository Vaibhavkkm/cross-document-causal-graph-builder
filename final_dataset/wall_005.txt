Abbasinia  August 19th, 1915.   Dear Mum  I recieved your letter the other  day & I thought I would write & let you know  that we havn't gone to the front yet but we  expect to be shifting shortly but I think it will  be to Suez for a while. We have joined in with  the 5th & 6th Brigades & have formed the 2nd Australian  Division & it is just the thing to be on parade with  about 20,000 men & artillery etc it seems a deuce  of a lot. I havn't seen Aunty yet but I will as  soon as I can. You were asking about the boy  from the tent, well I'm not in the same tent  now. But they are still getting on alright  Sid Bennett had a bonser dose of  Rhuematism coming over on the boat &  he is not properly right yet. Billy Smith  & Harry Alderson have been getting drunk  a lot & been put in jail a lot & I can tell  you it is a proper jail with British Tommies  to look after them. Nugget & the rest are  getting on alright. I hope Eve is getting  on alright & also yourself & by the  way I must wish you many happy 
returns of your birthday I won't be able  to send you anything home, but you must  promise to let buy something for yourself  out of my money & I will send you  something, as soon as I get flush with  money, but I suppose it will be a while  yet. I suppose you have been up to see dad  by now & I hope he is getting on alright.  I am feeling in tip top condition lately I  don't think I can remember feeling better.  I suppose it is having plenty of work & a  good bit of sleep & plenty of tucker. We  have been issued with helmets & they are  just the thing for the heat. We have  fairly cool nights over here. I hope Blanche  & Bob & Jack is keeping well & I hope they  have brought the boat home. I suppose  your old tank is well full by now with  all the rain you have been having. I suppose  Sth Australia will have a record crop this  year. We don't get much news over here.  about the War. They say they have got  Acha Baba surrounded now & once they  got that fixed up there is nothing much  but a straight run into Constantinople 
that will be the time Mum when we march  into Constantinople. I think they must be  going to go straight through to the Austrian  frontier when they take that for it seems to  be the general opinion of most of the officers  & I think it must be true by the numbers  of troops concentrating there. The Australian  Army is only a fleef fleebite to what the  English & French & Indian troo have there.  It may be that they think there will be a  rising in Egypt. it seems very shaky. I am  going to write to Ev with the same mail as  this. I must close now with love from  your loving son.  Wally,  P.S. I passed pretty well at the Zeitoun School  & I am sending the certificate home in this  letter & also the one I got at Mitcham as I  don't think I will want them here.  W.  I thought you knew that I was leaving  6/- a day behind & in fact I know I  told you.
