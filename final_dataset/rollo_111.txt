Text:  Dear Father & Mother.  We are just going to move forward we don't  know exactly where - but judging by the training our  Div. has been through - we're going to do something.  Fritz is back the other side of Bapaume  how far back we don't know - but we are going  to shove him back as far as we can.  In a few  hours we expect to be on the move, and as we are  travelling full marching order & as light as possible  one has to dump all his surplus Kit. - My batman is  at present wondering where I collect all my stuff  a great deal of it I daresay I won't see again -  but I hope to get along without losing much.  This little business will about finish any  chance of seeing G. for awhile; but they will hardly  keep us in line very long this trip - they will not  waste us in another tour when the "Push" is so near  Things are rather busy here this afternoon so  I will have to close now, & write again soon.  Enclosed is the back leaf &old lining of my  old pay-book which I have used as a sort of diary,  since being on the Somme.  I am copying the Will  into my new book.  Hang on to the diary - sorry I  can't give dates - Harry can find the places on the map.  Best of all good wishes, &very much love to you  From Your loving son  Rollo
