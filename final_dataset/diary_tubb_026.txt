Last day of June?  Went out to Mustapha at 9.30. and heard the same old tale. "Report at half past 9 tomorrow" I don't think the boat will go till Friday? I saw Connolley & he told me he was going to England shortly also) I got a few things from the base, boots, cap, kit bag etc. Ran up against three of my men from Mese, & they told me that Grant & Kong Meay were in hospital so I suppose Frank won't be able to come in today? & to go out to Moharem Bay shooting with me. Went to Moharem Bay & found out that the shooting is tomorrow not to day - Came back & met Dr Black of the 6th Bn at the Club, Capt Black is convalescent but his wound is not yet healed, The Post orderly (Jones) informed me that he put a lot of mail for Gallipoli on board the Royal George which sails for Base Y tonight strange; that I am not allowed to go over by here  Perkins a 7th man that has just returned
 
by a hospital ship states that the 74h Bn roll call; when he left was 523, my word that is very little considering the large numbers of reinforcements sent to the 7th since April 25th Frank came in at 7.30 & we had dinner at the Grano Palase Cafe sat out on the green & yarned till he left for Camp at 9 pm It gets nice and cool here in the evenings, being right on the sea the breeze is cool, F told me there was trouble in a unit in Miex Camp: the men counted their officers out & otherwise  misbehaved themselves. I am glad to say nothing like that is every likely to happen in the 7th Bn?!  Am putting in the evening studying French and Arabic  10.30 am off to bed.
