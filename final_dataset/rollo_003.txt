 We are exceedingly busy today as we are to shift camp - & once more start campaigning. However I 'telepathed' birthday greetings to you yesterday & again today. I have telepathed greetings to you  all. For the five will be at home today as I  believe. Wumps won't leave till the 24th. I'm sending a mixed assortment this mail films  views about the Pyramids - Kasr El Nil Bridge (compare size of cart or 'gharry' with lions - they   are immense) and one of myself on a camel - taken by a "gippy" guide - & which is almost unrecognisable when printed. Two other views don't print well - one of Mooski St. (where I bt. those presents). I stood on the top of the garry to take it - and I am sorry it does not turn out better. Another one I took to show the size of the granite blocks in the Temple of the Sphinx - but no luck. I have a good silhouette of the Sphinx - showing her minus her nose - I believe that is also with the lot. I can't say too much re news - it may be 2 or 3 weeks before you hear again - as we are going well out into the desert - about 14 miles the  other side of the Canal. Water & transport will be  our difficulties, but as we are 'front line' we ought.
