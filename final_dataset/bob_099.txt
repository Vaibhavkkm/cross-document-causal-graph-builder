  My dear Mum, Have just come out of the  line again and am glad to say  still not get another knock expect  to be out almost a month then  at it again with what degree  of luck remains to be seen  as far as I am concerned  Am still running A Coy and of   course am a very busy man  finding little time to write letters  have tons of news more or less  but will mention if briefly. Sorry  I did not cable about being  wounded in the Messiner show  see it was published in the   English papers however am quite  all right again was only away  for ten days. Saw Hank the other
day he had just returned to his  Battn loking very well with this   Commission we had a long yarn  and no doubt he has told you  all about his experiences in London  Since seeing him I heard he has  been wounded slightly and  went away from the Battn  but should be back again  very shortly Divine Providence  has indeed looked after life both  to date in a wonderful manner  Expect you will have heard  that I have received the   Military Cross for valour in  the field shall enclose a   bit of the ribbon I wear  General Godley presnte presented  me with my ribbon the other  day felt quite a head he 
said all sorts of nice  things then then first time I   get to London if lucky  enough again shall interview  Cousin George and receive my   medal. Received 3 or 4 letters  a couple of days ago all dated  April glad to hear from everyone  and that everything is right  Am writing to the Bank   of N.S.W London to transfer  another £100 to my account  there have a sort of feeling  that I may get to London   again and if so one must  have money there think my  account in Sydney will stand  it. Had a great cricket match  against the 15th Battn last  Sunday afternoon we had   a 3 point win I got 26  first innings & 20 not out  in second play the 14th Battalion 
tomorrow afternoon and if lucky  enough to win shall add  another cup to the Battn's  large list of trophies for  sport which is [[besea?]] the  Colonel and everyone takes a   big interest in these Brigade  sports gives us time off  for practice etc etc comes  and sees all the games   and is very pleased of course  when we do well. Had a  practice this afternoon but  had to knock off on account  of shrapnel being sent over  from Fritz feel since no sport  will satisfy me in the future  unless there is some excitement  from shelling or fireworks of some  description. Well my dear shall have  to knock off now will write again soon  lots of love to all, Bob.
