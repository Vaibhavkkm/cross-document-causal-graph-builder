My Dearest Mother & all at Melbourne, I suppose you have been wondering how I spent Xmas Day away from home, well, I must say that we have not only fared magnificently, but wonderfully. I could scarcely have believed that such a feast as we had, could have been prepared & cooked in the Sahara Desert. First, we exercised, watered & fed our horses, then we had a Breakfast of Chops, Eggs, Steak & Toast with Coffee (good) to drink, Then we were allowed to take it easy & get ourselves ready for Dinner & we filled in the time by cleaning out the tents & adorning the place with all kinds of decorations. Our tents are quite different to the ones we had at Broadmeadows. They are large tents about 20 feet long & 12 feet broad and are double to allow the air to pass all around & they are beautifully cool, Well we have lined the outside portion of the ground with white stones & the men have made incriptions & drawings on the sand & some of the designs are magnificent. We have fellows from all over the Camp to inspect our lines, & we made such a good job of it, that the  Colonel & Medical Officer, who made a surprise visit galloped up to the Major (ours) & congratulated him on the splendid appearance of our lines & he
later on brought the Officers of the other batteries over to see our fine display. Well, after watering & feeding our horses, we sat down to DINNER. and what a dinner too. For the men, Roast Turkeys, Roast Beef vegetables (leeks, ony carrots turnips & spuds) & of course in the Turkeys (don't get a shock) ONION STUFFING. Then followed Plum puddings & Brandy Sauce, & when these were issued to the men, they were set alight & put on the tables, blazing. I might say that before this, the men were allowed to send in one N.C.O. for each subsection to buy Beer & Whisky & Wine & other little delicacies & afterwards, all that could be seen was men lying about in all directions, (dead to the world) The Sergeants dined in a similar manner, only much more in style & we all drank to the health of the "Dear ones at Home". The Major went round to each mess & spoke kindly to everybody & everybody cheered him. I might say that the men have had  a large mess room built for them & this adds to the  comfort of a big dinner. There is one thing that I  want to tell you & that is my subsection sent for me  at dinner time & when I went to them, I found that they  wanted to Toast me, & in the speech that the Corporal  made, he insisted & all the men "hear heared" that 
I was the best Sergeant in the Brigade (mind you) & they  rose & sang "For he's a jolly good fellow & all that rot"  & gave me three cheers. Well I can't tell you how I  felt. This is the first time in my life that I have been  cheered & I hardly knew what to do or say & stood there  like a silly coot & after they had finished, I made  a short speech in which I thanked them all for  the willing & loyal assistance they had given me, & it was my best wish that we would all be together  that day, next year, in Berlin. This was a trump  card & they all cheered like blazes. This was not  the only thing, as I was sent for by the other subsections  & toasted the same way & no other Sergeant  got this distinction.  I only mention this to show  you how we are doing here & the good fellowship  that exists between all ranks. After a good sleep, Les Ilsley came in from the New Zealanders Camp & he spent the rest of the day in our company. We  had arranged, during the week, for a big spead  for 9 of us at 7.30 p.m., & so we went into Cairo in  a big Car & after a good hot bath we went to the  Cafe Parisenne & there we had 10 courses on  our big dinner, so you will see our digestive  organs had to perform wonders on Xmas Day. 
We finished up at mid night in a fine big Car & slept late next morning, & I must say that every body looked washed out, but they were all there when the Trumpet went. Les Ilsley enjoyed himself that much that he is going to apply for a Transfer to us. Well so much for our Dinner, now how  of about yours. I was thinking of you all at home all day & knew that onion stuffing must have been "favourite". We have just heard a Rumour that the Herald published a report that we had been Sunk in the Indian Ocean. If this is true, we are going to wreck the Herald Office on our return. Our work in the field is progressing favourably altho' the training of the Artillery has been altered since the outbreak of the war, so we have to learn a lot of new work. All my subsection are working great now & they are keen to obey my smallest wish, & altho I am sorry to say that one or two "Non Coms" were inclined to be "Cliquey" I spoke to the Section Officer about them & he spoke to them & pointed out that the success of the "Sub" depended on the absolute friendliness & comradeship of everybody & this has had the desired affect as they are all pulling together grand now. 
Speaking of the Sergeants, I must say that If the world had been sought over for a finer lot of  fellows, it would have been impossible to do ones find better. They all assist each other & do all sorts of jobs for each other, that it is a pleasure to know them & I am happy in the extreme in their company. Moon is about the least popular as he is inclined to be a little selfish at times & mingy, so we have nick named him (Cohen). Jack Hall is a big joke & is all ways keeping us in the best of humour. Fred Conradis is always doing jobs around the place & building all sorts of things. We have still  got of our Gramaphone & we exchange Records  with other Batteries. The niggers do all the dirty work  so we have a good time compared with Broadmeadows. Cairo is still dirty & smelly. The French women are very beautiful & marry any one with tons of money no matter what caste he is. Now Mother, I'll close now hoping this finds all in Victoria well So give my love to all at home, Miss Taylor, Charlie, Hettie & Family, George, Mab, Flos, & all  Relations & other enquirers & not forgetting Rupert. Best of Love to your dear self  from your loving & happy Son, Norman. 

Mabs birthday tomorrow, so I'll drink  her health & wish her the usual greetings.  Am sending her some Cards by  the same mail
