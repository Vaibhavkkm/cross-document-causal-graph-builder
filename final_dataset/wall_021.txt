In The Trenches Somewhere in France May 11th 1916
Dear Mum Well I hope this finds you well & not too lonely now that Blanche has left you & by the way I received  y  a letter from you about a fortnight ago & This is the second one I have wrote since so I hope you received it. I got a letter from Blanche (which she wrote from the Bay of Biscay) yesterday & she seemed to have had a very good time on her trip over. which I was pleased to see. Have you got a little girl to keep you company yet & if you have don't forget to let me know what she is like. I suppose Blanche didn't think much of me not sending her a wedding present but I fully intend to give her something worth having when I go to England on Leave which will most likely be on June the 2nd We are at Armentiers near Yrpres but be sure & not address my letters there. We are just over the Belgium Border & I think we will be doing something very shortly as we I have had to detail 2 men to look after our packs & stores when we advance. But mum I don't think the German Trenches will
be very hard to take as the Artillery does all the work long before the Infantry starts to go forward. Well old girl I hope you are keeping well & not worrying too much about your. Blanche. I hope Jack is keeping alright & not being too cheeky to his bosses. as he used to.  And I also hope that Bob is not giving you too much worry & cheek. Mum you must want more money than that which you are getting from Bob & Jack. you must take it from me that you must use my money when you want it & you see that you don't spend any that Dad sends you because you know that I want you to save up enough to get another house when I get home. because you know you don't want to have to worry about money when you get a little older. But you needn't wory you will allways have a little spot on (my farm) as Blanche would say Well old lady I hope that this finds you well as it does me. I must close with heaps of Love & kisses from your Loving Son, Wally xxxx.
