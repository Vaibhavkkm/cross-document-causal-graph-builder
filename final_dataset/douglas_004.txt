Major Brown asked me to become a gunner & to try for promotion, because drivers are always drivers & are never promoted. He gave me a week to think things over but at the end of that time I decided to remain a driver, he chaffed me at the time for not being ambitious & spoke of future Officers being needed for a permanent Battery at Guildford or Midland Junction but I told him straight that my ambitions ran in different lines & I would never have sufficient time to attend drill parades, etc, & that I was quite content to remain a driver. When we got here all the gunners were sent ashore & only a very few drivers & horses to accompany them as luck would have it I was sent also as a spare driver. I saw at once that the gunners were going to have all the fun in the firing line - our present position being too dangerous to land many horses, I grew rather afraid that I might get left rather in the back ground so I changed my opinion about drivers & gunners & the first opportunity I had to speak to the
Major I begged him to let me be a gunner which he has done. At present I am still a driver doing gunners work but my transfer is to be made as soon as possible. I don't know very much about the gun but hope soon to learn Tom Cusack & I have both decided not to worry about promotion & I think that after this campaigne is finished we have done all the soldiering that we ever want to do. I am afraid you won't be able to read half I have written, I am fearfully squashed up under one of our lumber waggons waiting for my clothes to dry, the only change I was allowed to bring. Our two days rest is up tonight & we go back to our gun. I trust everything is well at home. Lots & lots of love to every one especially your dear self from Your loving son, D. Barrett -Lennard.
