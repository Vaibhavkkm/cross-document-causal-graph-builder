1st A.G.H. Heliopolis 3.10.1915  Dear Mrs Thomas, As your son left in rather a bustle for Alexandria, I offered to forward a small book & some photographs for him. He was looking very well & in excellent spirits - He had been very happy here, but as all the men of his own age & period were going, I dont think he would have been able to content himself here - I was selfishly very sorry he went as I am very fond of him & he was such a cheery person to have to do with. He is very popular here & was doing a lot of most useful work. I will post the packet at the same time as this & will register it- With Kind regards Yours very truly Edgar H.M. Stephen Capt A.M.Co
