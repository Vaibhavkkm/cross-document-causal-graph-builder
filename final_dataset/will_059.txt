EL Arish  23 January 1917  My Dear General  Thank you very   much for you congratulations  I am delighted to hear that you  think I have done something to  deserve it.  I often hear the remark here  "If we only had Gen Birdwood with  us" We were all very proud to serve  under you and will always look  back to those days with pleasure  You seemed to understand the colonies  so well. Our one regret is that   you had to leave us.  Yours faithfully,  John Findear
