If you show this tell her where it came from 

 little triangular jib sails instead  of our orthodox planes. They   are used for grinding corn  & making flour. Every other day half the  battalion go ashore for exercise  I dont think there is anything  in the rumors that we  will be on the [[move?]] [[farm?]]  for a month. I have dared everything I own  to pass the censor on as  we have to go for a short  pull directly I will say  goodnight Yours ever Tom  Date: 10. 03. 1915
