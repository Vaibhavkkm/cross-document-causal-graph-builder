2/11/1916,  France, 
 Dearest Jennie  I am finding time  to write you just a   little birthday letter. to wish  you Many Happy Returns.  I trust it will be a   very happy day for you &  a forerunner of many more  to come.  I want to apologise  for this awful writing; but  the weather here is so  wet, that this very pencil is all  unstuck, & the lead keeps turning  up its nose at me. All the   same I'm in good health &   spirits.   I want you to accept  the enclosed little note & buy
yourself a little something that  you may want. I can't  get anything here at all  to send. Its only just a  trifle: but it will show you  you are not forgotten by your  old brother.  There is very little   doing on our front as the   weather is too bad & its  almost impossible to move.  Its simply a sea of mud  in which the boys sink up to their  hips. Its impossible to convey  a proper idea what it is   really like. I have much  to be thankful for in my  position, not having to go into  it. But very very seldom & its  been my luck up to the   present to avoid it. But our  poor poor boys are in an  awful plight. 
They manage to joke about  it all the same & you would  think it was a bally game  Well, dearie, I have   little else to say. Will you  please give Dad & Mum my  fondest love & tell them I'll be  writing as soon as I can; but on  no account to worry if the  mail is a little Irregular  for the next two or three weeks  Once again wishing  you a very happy birthday  God bless & guard you all  Ever your own old brother,  Ernie.
