 My Dear old Mother, Just a line to let you know that all goes well so far as I am concerned. Had a letter from May last night enclosing a cable that she had received from  Gussie. May replied at once saying that my wound  was only a trivial one. I got a bit of bomb in my thigh  - only a tiny fragment. I got it out at the ambulance  next day & went straight back to the Battalion & in  a few days it was quite healed. No trouble at all  now. I didn't think I would be reported in Australia  as wounded or I would have cabled to say it was  nothing. However you will get May's cable very quickly  in reply to the one that was sent & so won't worry.  Things are fairly strenuous here now-a-days, but all  seems to be going along well. The absolute orderliness of  everything impresses one very favourably, but I can't  write about this sort of thing. Never managed to  see Jack, & am not likely to now till this is all  over.  Feel as fit as a fiddle. Love to Pater & Nell  & much for your good old self  Ron  We have been having a fairly strenuous time lately & are a bit tired.
