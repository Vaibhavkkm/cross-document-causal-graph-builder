  “A” Co  (ALLEN S.C. 3002  (  (ALLEN R.B. 3003   Killed in Action - 14-8-16.    I knew both these men Allen, they were brothers in  A. Co IX Platoon. No.16 Section, with me. One of them  left Egypt with me to join the Battalion in France. The  other was already in the Battalion when I joined it. They  both were short, medium build, one dark, the other not so  dark. I only knew these Allen’s in “A” Co. In August 1916  these Allens, I and about 5 others were going from the front  line near Houquet farm to Sausage Gully for rations.  This was towards evening, but it was quite light. Whilst  going up “Tom’s Cut” near the front line a shell came over  and exploded on the parapet, killed the 2 Allen brothers  who were immediately in front of me in the communication  trench and wounded my brother who was just front of the  Allens. It killed both the Allens outright and a man  named White. I got. my brother away (he was wounded through  the arm and leg) and do not know what was done with the  Allens’ bodies but feel sure they would be properly buried.  I am positive it was the brothers Allen and they were  killed outright.   Informant:- W.
