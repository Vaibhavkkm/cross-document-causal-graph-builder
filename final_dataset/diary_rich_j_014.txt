Friday   Oct. 16th. It is now officially stated that we leave on the "Euripides" next Monday, but our destination is very much in doubt. Leu. Beer gave us drill in full company with the transport throw in He is a great soldier & respected by everyone about the camp. Payed at 2.30 and general leave was granted until 8 p m when a great camp fire concert was to take place on the ground. I met Marcia Elvy & Earnest Bosch at Farmers' & had a delightful dinner to the Tivoli after; a poor show indeed. Farmers certainly get up a good dinner at 4/6, The menu is somewhat overloaded  by French. The music, table decorations (poppies) and the whole appearance of the place was very pleasing Got back at 11.30. all safe.
