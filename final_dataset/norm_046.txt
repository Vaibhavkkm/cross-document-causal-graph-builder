Text:  Dearest Mother & all at Home.                      As you will see by the above address, I am   back out of harness, but not in Gallipoli, but rather in Hospital, resting.   I was picking up tip-top for awhile, but got off colour somehow  & my Sergeant mate in the 2nd Field Ambulance advised me to stay in   bed for a couple of days, but instead of getting better, my temperature  hopped up to 103o so he brought his Dr down to me & he at once ordered  me into Hospital.  I told him I did not want to miss going back to the   Peninsular with the remainder of our boys, & he said "it all depended how  I felt, but would do his best for me", however just as I was kidding myself  I was doing fine, my temperature went up again, so he examined  me all over, & transferred me to the Australian Stationary Hospital for  observation, & after being there for 5 days, was then transferred to the  "joint" I am now in.  (A Tommies Hospital with Australian nurses in   charge of the wards) No 18 Stationary Hospital.  It is not a patch  on our Australian Hospitals, both as far as Doctors & Orderlies & General  treatment is concerned & the only grub we get is boiled Rice or Arrowroot   & we are all heartily sick of it, & have promised ourselves something extra  special when we are discharged.  However, you will be pleased to know  that I am quite well again & my temperature & pulse are normal &  have been this last week & I hope to get out soon so please don't worry  Nearly all the patients here are Tommies, & what a   helpless lot they are too.  They are calling the Sister & Orderly all the  time.  The chap next to me is in the Royal Irish Fusiliers & a  most extra ordinary person he is too.  When he is spoken to, his  funny old face goes into all shapes & then he just stares & his mouth wide open too.  And most alarming noises comes out of  his face when he is sleeping, you know, something like a noise which  comes from a fowl with its head just cut off.  His face is going thro'  all kinds of contortions all day long.  He was making some of his  funny old noises yesterday & the Sister went & roused him & asked  him what the trouble was, & after a lot of hideous contortions Etc,  he said "His bhed was [[onaisy?]]" so his bed had to made afresh.  The rest of the Tommies are not quite so bad, but Sister told me  that she would rather attend to 3 Australians than 1 Tommy.  The harbour is still full of shipping & the Navy are having  the best of time kicking about in white suits & their warboats  are covered with a big canvas awning & nicely painted & all  that sort of thing.  The Lord Nelson & Agamemnon are the biggest   of the British & the French have a lot big ugly battleships doing  nothing.  We saw the British Submarine which was up the Sea of   Marmora for 31 days & she looked very slimy & dirty.  The mammoth ships Mauretania & Acquitania are both  here in Port.  The latter is an Hospital Ship, but the  former carries Troops & Stores.  The Aquitanias decks are  A to G above the water line & H to L below.  They are  enormous vessels.  but out of 9 of the 4th Battery who came away for  for a rest, only 3 are going back.  3 are in Hospital; 3 have   been ordered a further rest, so that leaves only 3 to return  to Gallipoli.  My Mail is at Gallipoli, so I haven't got anything  in the way of news from Home, but I told them to keep it there  till I return as it only goes astray when one goes into Hospital.  I told you in my last letter about the Colonel offering me  Column Sergeant Major & my refusing it on account of being  crook didn't I.  I am not doing any more about the transfer as  our Major talked me over & palmed me down, so I'll still be  with the 4th Battery.  Well Mother dear, I hope you are all   well at Home & elsewhere.  Give my love to them all & kind  regards to all kind enquiries & accept fondest love from your loving son, Norman.
