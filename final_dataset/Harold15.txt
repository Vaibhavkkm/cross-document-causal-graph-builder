 It was a pity one got so plpically tived on such a trip for really this was a beautiful excursion for a full minded man.   We get some fine cherries and hope to get more later, - the first I'd had for years it seemed.  We would halt 3 times a day - (one hour each stop) while the men were fed & provided with hot water for their tea, so we did fairly well. We detrained at a place was Hazelbrook at midnt. and then marched 4½ miles to this village, where we are billeted.  We are about ¼ of dist between Hazel. & Ypres, Armentieres is about miles off and all day long we can hear them at it - so prolably before long we will be in it too. Our old 10th Battn is in the trenches just west of A. so we have been able to get a little news from them.  They have had a pretty rough time but as they have given Fritz a harder time - things are not so bad with them. We are close to the Belg. border, and most of the people in this arllage are Flemish.  They have some interesting tales to tell of the eight day in Oct. 1914 when the Huns over ran this part.  Living results exist of their visit, & now we realise what 'war' means in one's country & the boys will fight like hell when their turn comes
