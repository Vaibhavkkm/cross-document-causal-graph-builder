Also received a Sydney mail  from Newcastle & Herald from   I know not where.           1st Aust Gen. Hospital  September 1st, 1915     My dear mother,  I am just writing another letter  - the very last for this mail as it is just closing  to say that I have at last received some  mail - 6 letters. Two from you dated 17th  & 24th of July. I suppose the others were  addressed to me on the ship & missed me.  I was so glad to get them but very sorry  that you have not been well, do hope you  have quite recovered, the 2nd letter said you  were better. Take care of yourself my dear  although I am not there to caution you.  I am established in a medical ward in the  Hospital now, formerly in charge of Major  Summers & have 71 beds to look after, most  of them cases of typhoid & dysentery. Am  admitting officer today & expect a train  of 174 wounded in presently. Have no time  for more just at present. Hope you  received my other letter, packet of postcards  & scent by this mail. Much love  from Your loving son,  Wilf.
