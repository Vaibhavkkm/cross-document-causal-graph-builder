4, AUDLEY SQUARE, W.  GERRARD 5365.  March 29th, 1917.   My dear General. It was exceedingly nice of you writing  to me about my speech about Kitchener and I immensely  appreciated it. My reference to his share in  your most successful & wonderful  evacuation of Gallipoli was  clumsily worded but I do not  imagine anyone could really  believe I meant to detract 
from your glory in that extraordinary  achievement & I should imagine  that the letter signed "Anzac"  was probably written in the  Editor's room. I am glad that I should have  been the first to publicly  protest against the foul  attacks on K's reputation. It was at the bombardment  of Alexandria that I first  met K in 1882 & subsequently  was at Suakin 1886-1887  with him as senior naval  officer in the Red Sea whilst  he was Governor & we had 
been great friends ever since.  But your long association with  him was of course much  greater & more intimate than  mine & I can understand  your feelings about him.  What a wonderful time you  must be having now in  France - always doing something  whilst we in England  have to sit xx impotently  reading about their the 
German atrocities ashore & afloat.  I quite agree with your remarks  about these commissions - I never wanted them but if  they had them I was  determined they should have  a soldier & sailor as  members of the commission. Spring has not yet quite  arrived but it is struggling  hard to conquer the hard  dying winter.  With sincerest regards  Yours, Hedworth Meux  When next you come over do let me  know
