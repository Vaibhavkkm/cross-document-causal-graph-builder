21.10.1917  My dear mother, Just a few lines to tell you that all the parcels arrived in a bunch together tonight, billycan with cakes in as good condition as when they left Australia though the billy was a bit dinged. I just wanted the billy very badly too & it was specially acceptable. The pleasure my dear, to receive it just as it was packed by your own hands with the little note inside, & all that it meant was more than I can describe & I just did wish to give you a real kiss & thank you, but as the seas divide us I can only send it by letter. It seemed to bring you so near & the little kitchen where the cakes were made, but though we long to be near each other we must do our duty still, my dear. as hundreds, of others are at present & be grateful that we are strong & healthy. The socks made by you, at the sewing meeting & both lots of tobacco arrived together so I had three parcels from you all at once. It is idle to thank you my dear, you know how much I appreciate it. I have settled down after my trip to Cairo & am quite in the normal routine again. If there is a small interval between this & my next, you know how uncertain mails are nowadays so just be patient. Some letters go by England & some direct I fancy & then our facilities here are not, at times very good though they have been recently. In much haste tonight my dear, just wrote to thank you, a great big hug & a kiss from Your loving son Wilf.
