My dear Mum, Am once again back in London after a very pleasant holiday in Scotland   Arrived back last Wednesday and went straight to the hospital and bed where I stayed for the next two days having a horrid septic throat and very bad cold.  Felt pretty rotten the sleeping berths in the trains are all heated and fresh air seems to be very scarce. However am quite all right again now am leaving hospital tomorrow when I report to our medical board who will decide what leave they will give me in the meantime   have taken a room at the Regent Palace Hotel Piccadilly where I shall stay for the present if long enough leave is granted shall probably get out of London for a while   where I don't know yet.  Had a letter from Nana yesterday he seems all right and doing well enjoying the new life says the Common wealth Bank fo say they have not that £40 there for him however he has fixed up with the bank of N.S.W so that he will be all right now The Common wealth Bank are most unsatisfactory to deal with they take weeks to get money for you if at all whereas the Bank of N.S.W cable for you and have the money back here and an account open for you in 3 days or so. Received a small parcel from you yesterday containing tobacco, cigarettes, writing pad, for which many thanks have had no mail for about 3 weeks but expect you are sending them direct to the battalion now so hope to get them eventually I see Ralf Kell is wounded again must find out if he is across here and if so look him up the battalion has been doing great strokes again according to a letter I had from Marks yesterday  Harry Murray and two of his men have been recommended for the V.C hope he gets it he is a great chap and a ripping soldier Well my dear shall write soon again hope all are well and everything in the garden lovely lots of love to all, Bob.
