 I have been along to Stanley Foster’s Batallion - I had a good deal of difficulty in getting any news. One man who said he knew him well said that Stanley had been  wounded on 6th August in the attack on Lonesome Pine  Ridge, & was now at Alexandria. Another man who was near him told me that me that he was missing after the attack - fate unknown. Finally  I got hold of Sergeant Wood of Stanley’s company. He also knew the boy well, as he lived in North Sydney  & says he often used to go to over to town with him in the
same ferry boat. Wood told me  that Stanley was missing after the attack. Numbers of our dead  are still lying out in front of the trenches, & cannot be got at, & a number more were collected  some time after the attack & being unrecognisable  were buried together. As many identification  discs as could be got were collected & brought  in, & amongst them was Stanley’s. One feels very dubious about accepting all the information that is tendered here, but this chap struck me as being reliable, & as knowing what he was talking about. I am afraid  that the poor youngster was killed then - at any rate that is certainly his sergeant’s opinion. Still, as I said, everything that one hears here is a lie - or at any rate 99%of it is. I tried to find the man who said that he (Stanley} had been wounded, but could not discover him. Will try & find him again tomorrow. He evidently  knew him, because as soon as I asked him if he knew Foster, he asked me if I knew meant “Stanley Foster”. This is Sunday night, & about 50 yards away a few men are some of the  most mournful hymn tunes that were ever invented. Altogether the little ensemble is not a cheerful one, & I think I will go to bed & try & forget the whole business for a  time.  Goodnight & much love. Give the little  people & Gussie & Nell my love - I will be mighty glad to see you all again. Your loving son
