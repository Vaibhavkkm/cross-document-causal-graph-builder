At. Sea. 12th September 1915. My. Dear Family, We are at present in the red sea. and it is indeed some hot. After 14 days with nothing in sight but water we came along the East coast of Africa and everybody was very interested and cheerful. We have passed several  steamers to-day and everything is very  interesting and new. For instance it is blowing a young gale to-night which  seems to hit you in cold & hot blasts alternately. Up to the present we have not yet had stopped since leaving Sydney it is rumoured we go to Suez direct the and finish our journey to E in the train. Mumps are the order of the day on board the ship Several of our chaps are down with them I hope it will not mean quarantine when we land. I have not been able to get four to play auction bridge but play 500 every day and night we get some great of fun out of it. Have come across a chap named Percy from Queensland brother to the dentist in Sydney. We have had some very interesting lectures on Egypt from one of the Sisters the  Parson & one of the Doctors places to see etc. etc. No doubt you are wondering where we are and what is doing but since we have had a through trip of course you the mails are still on board. The OC is OK. and seems to be having a good time. Tell Jane the Wattle was all right on 1st Sept. the S.M. got his all right and was indeed proud. Our chaps are practicing for their second concert the first one was a high success, in fact I have seen worse in Sydney. at the Tivoli The next time I  write will be from Egypt as mails close on board on Tuesday next. Well there is not much fresh news on the ship. Trusting you are all OK at home love to all. Boby.
