Letter from Brighton, 23 October 1915.


From Hav. Yusaf Khan K.I.H (Brighton) to Rangri Ghulam Muhammad, 40th Pathans, France (Urdu, 21/10/15). “I have heard that the 40th are under arrest, and that Havaldar Abbas and some others deserted to the Germans with a machine (gun). Is this true or false? It is a great disgrace to the regiment. Give my salaams to everyone from Subedar Gulodu down to the sweepers.”
