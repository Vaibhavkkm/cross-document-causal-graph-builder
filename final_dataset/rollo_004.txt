  To have plenty of fun before you get this. There  will be hard times & plenty of hard work entrenching etc  night outposts - long night or day reconnaissances  which will give us much mental & physical activity.  So we are eagerly looking forward to the change.  I am writing this like greased lightning as  mail closes 8 p.m. so will finish off soon.  In cleaning up last night I found I had  forgotten to send along my Will - I found it  rather dilapidated - so have had it re written &   re-witnessed.  I am unable to tell any more - would get crt. mrtl.  if this was opened as it is - so will close  wishing you all success & prosperity with much  love - & that you are all as well as I am.  Rollo    (Second letter  23.1.16)  I find I can’t get all in one envelope so  I’m sending two lots. I have put my torn  Anzac colors in with this - note the sewing  it is my own.  My trunk is at Cook’s again - write to them  if anything goes wrong  - it will cost about 4/-  a month for storage to - so send that amt. along  per Cook’s Adel. branch if necessary.  Best love to all  Rollo
