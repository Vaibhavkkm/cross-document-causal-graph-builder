December 2, 1914. Dear Father & Mother, - we are getting off the boat very shortly now; where & when I can't tell you but it is not in England or Europe. Things have gone really extraordinarily well up to the present. The difficulties of troopship life must either have been very much overdrawn - or we have an exceptional lot of troops - we were told that discipline was very difficult; that the men were likely to get out of hand & all that sort of thing. Just the reverse has been the case however & apparently without very much effort on our part. -- The further we travel - -  the more one is impressed at this crisis with the vastness of the 
British Empire & the number of resources it has to  - I feel certain that the men who return from this force will be – - the creation of a new element - One feels that it is really a great honour to belong to the force & so long as this keeps uppermost amongst us there should not be much trouble - Later. We have just received news (10.15 am) that letters are to be in by 2 p.m. & that there will be no censorship - we are lying at the Quay at Port Said; we are going to Alexandria to disembark there for Cairo.  - Yesterday morning while lying at Suez we saw a new fleet come along - about 12 or 15 transports escorted by a French battleship -  - The chief feature of interest about the Canal was the defence of it. We saw one Egyptian Camel Corps & one battalion of Royal Engineers but most of the garrison work was done by Indian (native) troops who were dotted in small detachments each about 150 strong all along the Arabian side. - In one case a football match was in progress.  It was very fine to see all these things - . Everybody is in food spirits. H. Gordon Carter
