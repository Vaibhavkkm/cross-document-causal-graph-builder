Some good goes have taken place, lately & report states that we have the best of it. We have received a memo from HQrs asking for a state of the number of men we can spare to go to Gallipoli - Rumour states that 20 tons of gelignite has been taken over to blow up Achi Baba
Quite a stir amongst us Transport officers Our C.O. here Major Ledder recommended that two of us could be spared to go to Gallipoli. After discussion, Lt Bain withdrew his claim, & Eller Bolton & I drew lots - I lost!! So Eller's & Bolton's names have been sent it together with the men we are sparing I am F & I are very disappointed: at my bad luck in the draw. I am continually wondering why I don't hear result of my application Later, I saw Major Holdsworth he does not think that any of us will be able to go, as none can be spared. He intends sending in a Nil return
