 Dearest Mother & all at Home, I received another most welcome letter from you & Mab, also a “Table Talk” & “Punch” so this gives us great joy & helps to fill in the time beautifully. I cannot tell you what joy it gives me to get your lovely long letters  & I read them over & over again. It is just the same with the rest of the boys, & on Mail days, one can find a chap in every little corner having a quiet little read. I am pleased to tell you that I am in the very best of nick & I hope you are all in the same health at home. We are still keeping the Flag flying here & defy the Turks to leave, & just to be nasty, we are going to bundle them out “neck & crop” shortly. Down at Achi Baba the bombardment is continuous & one simply marvels at the way the Turks can hold out against shelling they get,  & it goes on night & day. The Howitzer batteries are relieving us of a tremendous amount of work & they make a terrible mess of the Turks trenches Our Infantry are still thirsting for more bayonet work & hope they will soon get their wish fulfilled. They knock about the trenches almost naked & are as brown as berries, but quite cheerful. Body lice are our worst enemies & a lot of chaps wear their clothes inside out & look dead funny 
I was sorry to read of Rupert having cut his foot & hope it is quick better. Tell him I got his letter & I hope he will write me some more. Tell him the Australians give the old Turks “what for” & plenty of nice bayonet. I do not know who sends me the “Punch” each week, but if it is Jack Harthing, then I hope you will thank him Kindly for me. I have received no parcel from Uruchelsea which you mention, but hope they will not put themselves out, because I know they are so busy. Anyhow we get a very liberal supply of clothing from Ordinance, so we dont do so bad. Food is fairly good & very plentiful, but we would give £ for some fresh green vegetables. We can draw pay here every now & then, but I don't draw any as one can't spend it, so its better in the book. I hope Charlie has got permanent work ere this, & I also hope George has enlisted, because it would be nice to meet him abroad. I cannot imagine what a soft bed with white sheets is like, it is nothing but "funk holes" & dug outs here. My Corporal tells me the war will end next month, so if he predicts true, then I will sample some of the old original “Onion Stuffing” Etc very soon. Let us hope his prophecy will come true Well, mother dear, no more news at present, so will conclude, hoping all are enjoying the best of health; Please thank all kind enquirers & assurance  give them our assurance of British success. Best love to all at Home & an extra ration for yourself from your loving son Norman
