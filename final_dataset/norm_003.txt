Text:  Dearest Mother, Another line as I have a few minutes to myself, so I will tell you about the fine sight there is at present, in this Harbour. The harbour is surrounded by very hilly country & the water is very deep to within a few yards of the land, all the Transports are here and drawn up in 4 lines, each the whole length of the harbour, & there are 9 boats in each line swinging at anchor, and the Warships are guarding the entrance. The whole of the New Zealand Transports & Escorts arrived this morning, and presented a fine sight as the all came up in line. This is a rough sketch of the sound, showing how the boats are all drawn up, & if it is possible to get a [[Cinematograph?]] picture of it, it will be worth seeing on the screen; There are 8 warboats altogether  & they patrol outside the Bay.

We are still living like lords, and I have had no further trips to the side of the boat. The men are quartered in holds, now called Troop decks & are fitted up in the best of style, they sleep in Hammocks & stow them away during the day & they have large Mess Tables & enamel ware to eat from. Their meals are of the very best kind & for breakfast, they have Porridge, Sausages & Chops & Fresh bread & jam & pickles: For Dinner, Soup, Roast Beef or Mutton, 3 kinds of Vegetables & Plum or Rice pudding; For Tea, Cold Meat, biscuits & Jam, butter & milk & Cheese & Sugar and all those kind of things are plentiful. We Sergeants, have First Class (cabins-de lux) Cabins (3 in each) & First Class Saloon accomodation for meals & amusements & the meals are excellent &    one can have as much as one likes, we get fresh hot bread rolls every morning & I generally eat 5 or 6. Our horses are stabled on the Deck and we exercise them every day by walking them around the Deck, & they relish it so much that some of them don't want to go into their stalls again. Up to now, there is only one horse had to be destroyed, owing to pneumonia, & after being cut up for instruction, was thrown to the sharks No body is allowed to go ashore, only the heads & they have to go by means of a dirty tug boat. Braithwaite got vaccinated 2 days ago & all the boys kidded him that he looked terrible bad afterwards, so he went & saw the Dr & is now in the Sick Bay (absolutely frightened) It was only the other day, he was laughing at me for being sea sick, but I've got the laugh now. Our men are shaping very well & very few are sick. Dowsett is still trying to run the Battery & is giving poor Jock Adams a bad time, he is a fair rotter & would swear a mans life away, I don't take any notice of him & I answer him straight out & shut him up. Tell, Mab, that I don't think I would take on a Sea trip for pleasure, it gets too monotonous & no room for running about. How is Charlie & Hellis & Children; give them all my love. Hope George is well & business a success. I will try & write to Winchelsea next time, but when you write, tell them I am alright & thinking of them often. Will close now Mother with fondest Love to all from your Son Norman  Six weeks trip to Port Said. We sail from here Sunday.


Write to Aunt Hannah & tell her I am thinking of her, & will write soon 
(next day) Have just had this letter handed back to me, as they are going to censor all letters

I will try another way of posting it
