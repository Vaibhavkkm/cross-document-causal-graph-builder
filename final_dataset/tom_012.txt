 My Dear Eileen Since writing last week an Australian  Mail has come to hand. I received your letter of March 11. I am so sorry you didn't receive any letters for 3 weeks I posted one each week. I had a letter from Campbell & Jack O'Connell by the same mail. Campbell has written a letter I have not received. Chapman has been given a commission in the British Army He was one of those recommended at Mena & is the only one in the brigade to get one. Quite a host of 'Land & Waters' has come along lately. They are remarkably interesting. I hope you have been able to get hold of some. There is just a chance of No 19 reaching you about your birthday but I cant promise This will probably reach you on May 24 or  thereabouts I am sorry I can't offer you a better birthday letter but I know you will understand. Nothing further has happened since I last wrote & things are going on as usual. We are getting our 3 meals a day regularly & some of the benefits of civilization so I suppose there is nothing to complain about. To-day we received a very welcome issue of ½ lb each of Capstan tobacco. I have quite a stock now. You may possibly receive some photos posted in Adelaide. Rhodes has sent some films home & asked his people to post one or two to you. This may possibly be the last letter for a while so don't be disappointed if a mail or two misses you. Wishing you many happy returns of the day With love from Tom.
