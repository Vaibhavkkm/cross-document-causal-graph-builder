Moascar 19/2/1916 My dear Jane. Received your letter dated 6th. January also from Lorna dated 2nd January also received the parcel containing socks tobacco pipe cigarettes etc everything was in good order and greatly appreciated the pair of socks for Nana were duly handed over to him if I do not get time to write to Amy  and Mrs Vale for the cigarettes & mittens kindly thank them very much for me and let them know how useful all these things are. Les Henley had a couple of days leave this week and picked up the "Osterley" coming through the canal about 2 miles from here it must have been great for him to row out and crawl over the side of the boat to meet his Mother it he is back again now but have not seen him to talk to yet We are about to move from here tomorrow I think to a place called Tel-el a Kebir about 25 miles from here towards Cairo then the Anzac combination is to be done away with we are being separated from the New Zealanders and forming a purely Australian Division half of one battalion is being split up and put in with some other people in fact do not know quite yet what is going to happen everybody is dreadfully upset both our chaps & the New Zealanders. We have had a farewell concert a few nights ago. it was very good but in parts very sad. Nana was going up to Cairo to-day but at the last minute all leave was cancelled so will be deferred until we are fixed up at our new place We hope to receive the ₤20 he cabled for both being pretty broke. I gave Nana £8 when arriving on the peninsular so that he will now be able to repay me it is indeed marvellous how money goes. here- but one may as well have as good a time as possible. No news. here may be more next week. lots of love to all Bob.
