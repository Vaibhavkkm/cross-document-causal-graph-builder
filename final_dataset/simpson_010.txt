25th December 1914.    Dear Mother  Just a line to let you know  that I am still in Cairo It  is X Mas Day today I was look  forward to spending today in  Shields but I was doomed to be  disappointed I would not have  joined this contingent if I had  known that they were not going  to England I would have taken  the trip home and had a holiday  at home then joined the army  at home and went to the front  instead of being stuck in the  ungodly hole for all that you can  see is sand and drill from  morning to night and the grub  is very poor and not half enough  of it I have lost about a stone  in weight since I joined the  contingent for when I joined  I went 12 stone 7 pounds and dont go near 12 stone now What  sort of a X Mas did you have at  Shields I suppose that every thing  is pretty quiet on account of the  war Now Mother when we left  Australia I made out a form  for to leave you two shillings  per day all the time that I am  in the Australian army I hope  that you are drawing it all right   and I am having two Shillings  per day put to my account in  the Commonwealth Bank in  London and I am drawing one  shilling per day for pocket money  and I have to spend it all on  grub for we dont get enough  to eat You will be drawing  your money through the  Commonwealth Bank in  London So that I hope that  you are drawing it all right 
I made it over to Sarah  Simpson as I am in the  name of Jack Simpson here  in the Section I hear that  we are likely to move from  here in about six weeks time  and whether we will go to  England or the Continent  I could not tell you But I  hope that we will go to  England for I would give  anything to have a run up  to Shields to see you and  Annie before I went to the  front I see by the papers that  the Germans have killed alot  of people in Hartlepool they  were pretty close to Shields  I hope that they dont get as  near again for I would not  like to see poor old Shields  knocked about by the Germans 
but they will have to pay  the piper for it all in the  long run I would like to  have the pleasure of putting  a bullet through the damned  Old Kaiser for he is the start  of the lot But it is just as  well for it to happen now for  it had to happen some time  Now Mother I hope that these  few lines will find you and  Annie well as it leaves me at  present So with love to you  and Annie  I remain  Your loving Son  Jack  P.S. I wrote you a letter last  week I hope that you got it all right 
P.S My Address is  Private Jack Simpson  C. Section  3rd Field Ambulance  Australian Contingent  Mena Camp, Cairo, Egypt
