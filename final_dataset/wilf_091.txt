SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL CAIRO 17.6.1917. My dear mother, In Cairo once again on seven days leave ! It is very pleasant to come to civilization once again but there is a heat wave just at present & we are sweltering & sweating day & night. But for all that I am enjoying life well. Tonight I had dinner with the Bryans & went to church with them & told them I expected a brother here shortly so must send Jack along to them when he arrives. I heard today that reinforcements were expected at Moasca & met the Adjutant of the camp there who was returning 
there tonight & he promised to wire me whether they arrived or not & if Jack has come I will go back earlier & spend a day there. We had a wretched trip down on the other side of  the canal - spent the night in an open truck half smothered with soot from the engine. I never thought when I used to hear of people travelling in open trucks that I would do it & can't say I appreciated the experience very much - hope I can do better on the return trip. I have been round the hospital seeing some of our wounded & some of the nurses I know - they all look a  bit fagged after their recent hard work. 
This place is very comfortable to stay at, but at present almost unbearable indoors. Parry who went through the university with me came up with me & it makes things much more pleasant to have a companion. We went for a run out to The Barage of which you have heard me speak & also to the Pyramids both of them very nice trips indeed. But my dear its far too hot inside. I’ll write more when I go back to the
 desert so will close with much love from Your loving & very hot son Wilf.
