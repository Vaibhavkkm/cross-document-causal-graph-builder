 My dear Mum, Very distressing news late last night a wire from the Battn telling me to return at once rotten luck having to go back at such short notice and in the middle of my holiday am leaving here at 11-50 to-day for France to rejoin the Battn Trust they
have not had too bad a time although it looks very much like it to me Had a very nice letter from Colonel Durrant who is in Scotland telling me to take 2 extra days leave and he would probably see me in London before I returned however that is knocked in the head now Was going to do all sorts of nice in in the next few days 
Still it is all in the game and one is getting too old these days to let tell a little disappointment like this worry me Shall write a decent letter when I have time just off to see Millie Hurley and then on to the train Lots of love to all, Bob.
