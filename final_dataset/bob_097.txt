My dear Mum, Just a line to let you know I am leaving tomorrow and should be back with the Battalion the same day whether they are in the line or not I don't know but they  are close up so if not actually in will be at it again very shortly wonder what it will  be for me this time afraid one cannot go on being so lucky indefinitely however that remains to be seen. The leg is all right again can just feel it at times the little piece of stuff buried in some muscle presses on same when  the leg is in certain positions no inconvenience caused though if I have occasion to go to hospital at some future date shall probably get it taken out. Have had a lovely ten days rest here very comfortable good food plenty of tennis bridge swimming billiards this would do me for the duration but of course we must go and do a bit more. Expect to have some mail waiting for me on my return have had none for nearly a month. Shall write again soon lots of love to all, Bob.
