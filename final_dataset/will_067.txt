London 16 February 1917  Dear Sir With reference to my telegram concerning an appeal to G.H.Q., the copy of the cable you sent to Australia is certainly not quite what I had been led to believe. At the same time your views, as expressed in your letter, were entirely unexpected by me.  Any Appeal even if upheld would in these  circumstances be futile, because I should still have to return to Australia. General White has no doubt informed you that 
I am leaving England by the Kaisar-i-hind today. I trust your opinion of the 2nd Aust. Div. may  now be changed Yours obediently,  JW Legge
