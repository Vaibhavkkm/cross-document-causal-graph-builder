Extract from letter of 

Author: Lieutenant A. D. Henderson, 

Regiment: 7th Battalion. 
Date: Written on Saturday, 24th April,1915,

 the eve of landing at 
Location: Gallipoli.
 "At last we make our final move and very soon we will have started to do what we came away for and have waited so long to do. While you are in Church to-morrow thinking of us, we may be needing all your prayers as it is either going to be a hard fight or an easy walk in, but everything is ready and everyone quietly confident of success. It is going to be Australia's chance and she makes a tradition out of this that she must always look back on. God grant it will be a great one. The importance of this alone seems stupendous to Australia while the effect of success on the war itself will be even greater. The Battalion (7th) is up in the front again with an important job before it, and there seems no reason why it should not do well. ----- I will be the senior sub. Rupert's ship is close by, and need have no fear of his success, he is pretty thorough and careful in everything he does.--------- P.S. This censorship seems peculiar. There is a Sydney mail on board in which it is stated where we were coming, and giving the General's name and a number of particulars.
