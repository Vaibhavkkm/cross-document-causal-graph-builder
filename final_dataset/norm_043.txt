 Dearest Mother & all at Home. Just a line to let you know that I am well & am pleased to say that I have just received another "bumper" mail & have just read them all for the second time or more. I am glad to know That Charl has a good job at last & hope it will be permanent. Tell him that I am grateful to him for his bonzer letters & to Etus & family for their kindness in going to such trouble for me. In his letter he  asks "did Ben Cantor have charge of my gun when he got killed", Tell him "No Ben never had charge of my gun on any occassion. My gun was the only Gun in the whole Division to land on the Sunday 25th April & I had charge on that, all occassions.  Ben Cantors Gun & Ben came ashore on the Monday following. You will be pleased to know that I have been transferred to the B.A.C. & am doing the duties of Sgt Major, although I still hold the rank of Sergeant 
Things are very quiet here just at present & everybody is making his quarters "comfy" for the winter months. I am well off for Boots, Clothes, Etc. so, don't mind. I haven't received your latest parcel containing socks, Scarf, Bootlaces, Chewing gum Etc, but it will be here in a day or two. Am glad Jack has permission to come away, & also May Tilton. Good luck to them. I am camped in an Office on the Beach & am becoming quite a Pen pusher, & I like the job immensely. Am glad to know that the recruiting got such an impetus, it is the best news we could wish for. Thank Mab for her bonzer letters also her kindness in sending me all sorts of things, I'll not forget her Kindness. How is Floss Robbie, give her my love, also to Aunt Hannah & all Relations I hope all are well at Home Give my love to Rupert, & to George & Mab & all others & an extra ration of love for your dear self from your affectionate son Norman.
