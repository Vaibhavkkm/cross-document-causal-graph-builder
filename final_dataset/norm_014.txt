Text:  My Dearest Mother & all at Home  Am pleased to tell you  that I get your & Mabs letters regularly every week now,  & I can't tell you what pleasure it gives me to read  them over & over again. It is simply great to come  back to camp after a hard days work to find 4  or 5 letters waiting for me. I have read with deep  interest the different cuttings out of the newspapers  also the Church notes. Fancy having our names  in the Church Porch (Is mine there).  We are all getting on fine here & are right up  to our neck in hard work & all the the boys are  working great & are dying to have a fight with  someone. Turks or Germans let em all come.  Yesterday the 1st Brigade (New South Wales)  did their shooting & to day, the 2nd Brigade  (Victoria) that is us, had their turn, & I want  to tell you Mother, that our Battery has come  out on top of the lot in everything. Our advance  into Action, we were told by the Head Quarters staff,  was the finest they have ever seen. Our Officer said  it was a treat to see the way we trotted up all in  Line & properly dressed & not a word was spoken.
So quick was our fellows, that our horses had only  just time to get clear, when I got my first shot off.  We had 3 different Targets & our Layers did well  at each & when we got "Cease Fire" Limber up" our  drivers came up nice & steady with the Gun Limbers  and as soon as we "Limbered up" we all trotted out  of action just as well as we came in. The Permanent  Battery (No 1) admit that they can't touch us. So you  see the old St Kilda battery have started well.  I know you will all be pleased to know of our good start  & we hope to spell our names in shells (18 pounder) in Berlin  very soon.  We don't go into Cairo much now as the novelty has  worn off it a bit, but each Friday Afternoon we go  into Shepherds Hotel (Menzies of Cairo) & pay (5 Piastres) 1/-  & have a lovely hot bath & a clean change of clothes  then a bonzer "blow out" (2/-) & then Motor Car to Camp.  Nice isn't it. We generally go for a nice trip on Sunday  afternoons & thoroughly enjoy ourselves. Now Mum, I have  not much news this time so hope you will excuse a  short letter. I hope all are well at home. Give my kind  regards to everyone & best Love to all Ellsworths & an  extra ration to your self. I am your loving son  Norman.
