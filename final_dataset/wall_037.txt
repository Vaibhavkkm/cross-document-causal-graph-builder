France  10.1.1917   Dear Mum,  Well old lady I do hope this finds you  very well & having a good time. Also I hope that  Dad is quite better again. I have just received a  couple of letters & 3 bundles of papers from you. We are in the trenches at present & we are very lucky to be able to get anything at all just here but a  chap I know was coming in from away back & he brog brought them in. I don't know when this will  get away because it is very awkward job just here where we are on the Somme. But we are  having a very good time & we are well satisfied as long as they don't land one of their shells right on  out shelter it is just a sheet of iron over us & not very good trenches, but we always trust to providence  here. I get letters from Blanche fairly regular & also  a couple from Bob & I always get one or two from Ev.  Well Mum I havn't much news this time as we  are not alowed to say much even if we censor our  own letters so good night with love & kisses & best  wishes from, Wall.
