4.2.1917  My dear mother, After writing my last letter & telling you I had received one letter, the other came along a couple of days later being registered. I hardly think it is necessary to put on the extra twopence my dear, the mail is very good just at present. I think I forgot to tell you that, when in Cairo, I sent a cheque of £50 to the Commercial Bank in Candelo through the Sydney head office, as the Anglo-Egyptian bank in Cairo told me that was the safest & cheapest course, & I enclosed a note asking them to give you complete control over it as over the rest, so you please do just what you think best. It had been accumulating in my pay book from before Gallipoli as while there we couldn't spend anything & while in the desert we don't spend much except when we go to Cairo & then it is awkward getting money just at the right time but I have avoided that now oy putting some in the bank. I have "Ginger Mick" as Harry sent it along to me but it was very kind of Dr Sharp to send it along, I must write & thank him. Just at present we are very well off in deed for reading matter as we have all been to Cairo & bought books back with us & we have just received some books from the Red Cross in addition. However we will move when the time comes, with the stuff we are accumulating here now, heaven knows, but there will be a good deal of sweating done by myself to try & get the load on the camels - note that we are likely to move just now as far as we can see- still one never knows. I have been away again this week only to Kantarah this time (look it up on your map my dear) & had just a flying trip there & back on duty. I can't tell you what the duties were as that would be giving away state secrets. However it took me a day trotting round. I left here one morning at about 7.30 a.m. per hospital train & had quite a long  trip as the wind was blowing very fiercely & raising clouds of sand with it so that in places where the line runs between small cuttings the sand obstructed the line & we had to stop & dig an a way for ourselves through it in some places & to make matters worse our old engine went bung & we had to send for another, so that it was late at night when we arrived at our destination. Capt Yuille who is from this Ambulance & was going on leave to Cairo accompanied me & I was glad of his company. We were treated well on the train & managed to get some nourishment on board & in the evening we chummed up with a Scotch officer who was a patient going down to have his appendix removed & another doc. & played bridge  for 3 or 4 hours & this kept us amused so that we did not notice time passing. When we arrived we set out looking for a home for the night, walked a couple of miles & got a boat over the canal & directed our steps to a small camp which has been established by a Mrs Chisholm for the convenience of officers & men travelling up & down from Cairo. Trains arrive at all hours of the night & very often in fact almost invariably those coming from this side do not fit in with those leaving on the other side of the canal which are part of the Egyptian State Railways & men who have gone down from here, sometimes spending nearly 24 hours on the trains without being able to get food or drink, would have to spend the night out in the open but for such an institution. So that it is really  a noble work they are doing. They supply  meals & good ones too at a nominal cost, & bl beds blankets etc. The YMCA &  Church Army also have similar institutions somewhere in Kantarah but not run by Australians & of course we always make for our own if possible. Mrs Chisholm is a small delicate looking oldish lady & is assisted by a Miss McPhillamy a well known name in N S Wales I think & they both look quite tired out, as they have had a rush lately & the night we arrived all the beds were full, but we were given a couple of mat blankets &  were quite happy to doss on the floor of the tent with over coats as pillows. I was occupied all next day with my work & returned the same night by hospital train & had a beautiful sleep all night in a comfy bunk with sheets & blankets, waking up this morning when we arrived here. I had breakfast with our Immobile  
Section who are situated near the station. Hearing that there were some Ambulances which belonged to our worthy cousins division near by I trotted off to see him as I have been expecting him up here for some time & have been keeping an eye open. Sure enough he was there & wanted to know all about Rafa & Magdaba, asked after you & so on. He looks very well & seems to like the place out here, it certainly is much more pleasant than the desert where no water is to be seen. Now I am back again & all is well, have been fairly busy today straightening things out one way & another & now think I will turn in to bed, smoke a pipe & read a novel very contentedly. It's beautiful to go to bed when it's a little chilly & smoke & read, one feels quite a philosopher then like Diogenes again. A Life came safely to hand & some Sydney Mails from Em last mail thankyou all very much, with love to all the old family & an extra share for mother from Her loving son, Wilf.
