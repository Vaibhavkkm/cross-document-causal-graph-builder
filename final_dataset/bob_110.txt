My dear Mum, Once again in London having until 6th Oct leave Of course am having the time of my life already I must be a Jonah the bombs seem to follow me from France there being an air raid on London last night it was great fun to me to see the people
make for the Tubes etc some of them got very excited personally I felt very safe this will always do me Passing Liberty's yesterday I dropped in a bought a leather blotter which I think you will admire & like the h hand tool work on the leather seemed exquisite to me still I am no judge trust you get it all right and somewhere about Xmas time.  As soon as I can get some clothes made about 
Wednesday shall probably take a trip to Liverpool for about 2 days to see the good Hope then I want to go to Scotland also have th all the Countesses etc to look up shall be simply going like mad for the next ten days. Am looking up the Henleys to-day 
Have met a lots of my old friends again at the Carlyle club etc it is great seeing them all again going to the theatres dinners etc etc only wish there were 48 hrs in a day and 148 hrs in a night while here  However shall make the best of my time and take full advantage of it   Shall write again soon lots of love to all. Boby.
