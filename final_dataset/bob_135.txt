 Date: 21st April 1918,  My dear Mick, Still going strong and very busy received two letters from you lately for which many thanks  Am writing to the family so you will hear all the news which is not very much. Have just written to London Bank N S W asking them to transfer £150 to their branch from Annandale expect I have that much there but really dont know asked you to let me know how I stood financially but you have not done so yet. Like to have plenty of
money on this side one never knows what will happen of course there is tons of fighting here at present the Australians have done indeed wonderful work and saved the situation on more than one occasion and we expect much more fighting before things become normal again The position is a bit obscure at present but think the Hun will come a big crash eventually but I fear me only at a very large cost however time will tell we just plod along and make the best of things a few years of this & one treats life very cheaply really and yet it is wonderful the narrow escapes one has then again they only seem to be deferred lately 
Some of our officers have been killed who landed on Gallipoli with the Battn on 25th April so that apparently it is only a matter of time however I am easy kid on the whole matter one must look at this game from a philosophic stand point. Had a beautiful day in the line to-day clear sunny & bracing plenty of air fights which were most interesting and great to look out What do you think of this rhyme. There was a young lady of fashion Who loved a man with great passion And she smilingly said as she jumped into bed Theres one thing Lord Rhondda cant ration Written by an English lass to me pretty hot dont you think? Cheers ol kid for the present lots of luck Bob. 21/4/18
