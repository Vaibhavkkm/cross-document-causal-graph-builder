My dearest Mother,
The day after I last wrote to you I
heard that Les had been wounded, but I
have delayed writing on the offchance of
finding out the nature of his wounds.
He was wounded on 25/8, and shifted
from the 61st. C.C.T. to the 8th General Hospital,
Rouen on 31/8.  I am expecting any
day to hear he has been evacuated to
England, and hope such will be the
case before the 13th, when I go on four
days leave to London.  I was to
have gone yesterday, but have delayed
it a week on hearing the news.
I daresay you know by now, and
I sincerely hope you will not worry
overmuch dear mother, and break down
your health.  I have been worried a
great deal on your account, but of
course I await definite news of
misfortune before taking anything to
heart.  I always look at it in the 
light that it will mean a trip to Australia for a certainty, and hope
his wounds will not prove too serious.
I shall send you a cable from
London next weekend, when I
should have definite news about Les.
I had a letter from him on the
20th 'Aug. and as I said in Ruby's
letter, the fighting was pretty severe
although our troops have done so well.
I cannot help feeling sorry to
think you will have the news about
my returning to France about the
time you hear of Les being wounded.
It is just circumstance, and I
trust you will prove as brave as
you have always been, and rely on
prayers.  Up till now we have been
very fortunate and there is no
reason to think our luck is going to
change.
Things are running smoothly here, and
my arm is alright again.  I hope I shall
have good news for you next mail, and
will conclude with much love to all
from           Your affectionate son,
                                    Jim.
