April 11, 1918 – Above lady & child doing well. Sent to Hazebrouck to hospital. Nothing doing rest of the day but sitting around camp helping to feed refugees. Last of refugees were sent away at 6:30 p.m. Then went & had dinner and prepared to get to bed. About 10 p.m. the Huns began shelling us so we left on train about 12 p.m. By this time shells were bursting all around us. Went thru Hazebrouck to Ebblinghem. Arrived 4 a.m. Had to sleep in hay loft with nothing but hay for cover.
