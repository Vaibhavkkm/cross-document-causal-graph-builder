November 26th.   Sunday. A wet and nasty day. The calendar says it is Sunday but there are no indications to prove it either right or wrong. There was some pretty sentiment about Mollie Reynold's parcel which arrived today. The socks I will be thankful for and the eatables I will try and hold on to for a while now, as there will probably be hard times coming along shortly, although they say the 1st Brigade are going road making and not into the trenches again.
