There was to have been another route  march this week but the news comes out  tonight that it is cancelled.  There are  rumours that we are moving on Friday.   Something is doing this week I think.   Warships of all descriptions come & go.   We don't know half their names.   A big French hospital ship the 'Canada'  came in Thursday and went out to-day.   Nothing out of the ordinary has happened  lately.  We are enjoying the [[ca et]] fresh meat, cheese  & jam. Plenty of potatoes & onions in the  stews make up for the lack of vegetables.    We have found raw onions sliced with  cheese make good sandwiches.  The onions  are pinched from the stack near the  galley.  It certainly has its disadvantages  the onions I mean.   I forgot to tell you those letters you couldn't  find They are probably in the wooden case  but I expect you will have found it long before this reaches you.   Easter Monday  Another gale blowing from the North.   The last mail has not gone yet and we are  off on Friday.  That's a precis of to-days news.   Things have started to move  One blanket  each was packed up preparatory to putting  on the Malda which will carry the first  line transport.  Everything in the shape of  waggons ammunition etc goes in the first  line transport.  Kit bags are left at a base  which in our case will be the boat for  until a safe land base is established at  any rate.  Horses will be reembarked tomorrow.   I wonder what the next fortnight will bring  forth.  It looks very much as if we will  be in it before then.  I would give anything  to be able to express my thoughts to you  but it seems impossible.  I only hope  I won't show all the cowardice I am sure  I will feel.  Oh well I suppose there will be  plenty in the same box.  The Inflexibile is still in
