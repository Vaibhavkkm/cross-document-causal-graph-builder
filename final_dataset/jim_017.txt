My dearest Mother & all at home,
Your welcome letter of 9/5 just to hand.
Am glad you are getting some of my 
letters.  There is no sign of the parcel 
as yet, but I live in hopes.
I have some very good news.  Les 
will not be going back to France for 
at least another month. He has just 
written to tell me he has not got
anyone to relieve him and does not
expect anyone for at least a month. 
During the last few days I 
have seen Jack Richardson and 
Ron Gibson, both old U.H.S boys, 
and just arrived from Australia a 
few weeks ago.  Jack is in camp
near the town of Bedford and Ron 
is a Sgt. in the Ordnance Corps and 
is stationed in London for the present
He is a military Staff Clerk in 
Melbourne, hence his stripes.
You have got no idea how glad I 
was to see those boys.  Wally Cosgriff 
called in to see me yesterday.  He is over on leave from France and 
is just back from Scotland.  He is 
Armourer S.Sgt in the 39th Bn; a good 
job.  He is looking very fit and well.
Bill O'Brien is working with him 
in the armoury and is keeping well. 
I am glad to hear Gordon 
Stirling got home alright.  You 
might remember me to him and 
to Mrs. Stirling and the girls.
I was ever so pleased to 
get Gertie's snap taken at 
Traralgon.  She appears to be ever 
so big, and a bonny little girl.
Lenore must be a bonzer little kid. 
She will think it is her birthday 
when Les and I get back.  You 
did not say how you enjoyed 
your trip to Ballarat.  I hope you 
had a good time.  How is Auntie 
Kate taking the bad news about Alex. 
I am writing to her by this mail. I had a letter from Reg. Bennett 
yesterday.  He was telling me 
about the celebration of Anzac Day.
I think there is one of your letters 
missing because you have not 
mentioned Anzac Day.
Today is American Independence 
Day and a great day it has 
been.  King George and all the 
heads were at Stamford Bridge
to witness a famous baseball match 
between teams chosen from the 
U.S. Army and Navy.  It finished 
up in a big victory for the Navy.
The Yanks are hustling some, 
now, and have 1,029,000 troops in 
France by now.  276,000 for the 
month of June was good going. 
The German offensive has been 
brought to a standstill, and in 
view of the Americans arriving "in 
big lumps" the situation is rather 
more cheering than for some months 
past. 
I went to the National Sporting 
Club last night.  The Yanks have arranged a series of boxing 
events, known as the "American 
and British Empire Competitions."
An Australian named Smith (just 
lobbed over) won the Middleweights, 
and another named Eugene was
"runner up" in the Lghtweights, won 
by a former English champion, 
Seaman Hayes.
This news will not be very 
interesting but I just write as 
things come into my head.  I 
am lying on Putney Heath, and 
it is quite light enough to write 
at after 9pm.  I must be 
getting home however as I must 
be up before 7 in the morning. 
I trust you are all enjoying 
the best health and keeping your 
spirits up to full height.  Much 
love to all from 
Your affectionate son
Jim
