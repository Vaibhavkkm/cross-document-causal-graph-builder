Dear Eileen,

A mail is leaving today for Egypt, M
but I dont think there is a connecting one 
at Port Said next week for Australia; however
I don't like to miss a chance. I was able to
get No 18 cor covering from March 3rd to
March 22nd (page. 40 - 100.) off on the latter date.
C5 went with it partly explanatory. There
is just a chance of it getting through. for
There is some talk of us landing here
for a while. A spell ashore would be pleasant.
It is well over three weeks since we had a 
mail. I heard the reason was that the
Egyptian authorities did not want to take
any chances of betraying our position.
However, I believe we will have one in
a weeks time as I heard Gen. Birdwood
had cabled.
No sign of Gay yet. Everything is going
along well. I think we are in  for a good 
time.         
With Love, Tom.

here for a month I think waiting for a hundred thousands troops hamilton is in charge the French leave first 3rd Brigade forming covering party for landing three weeks
