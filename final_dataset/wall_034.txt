In France  December 16th 1916.  Dear old Mum,  Well here I am again not  dead yet you see, I received yours & Jacks  letters today & writing straight away. I am  back with my Batt again but we are  not in the trenches at present But as   bad luck happens I fancy we move in on  the 25th. Christmas. Day So I hope you think  of me up to my waist in mud & slush.  & all sort of things. The ground is all  churned into a jelly by the constant shelling  & it is great fun to see somebody stuck up  to their waist in mud & the other chaps  with an overcoat through his crutch  heaving him out but although there is   a funny side to it there is also another  side the poor chaps got what they call  trench feet with standing in the damp  & the flesh swells up & bursts through the  skin & rheumatism is another common  thing I suppose one will come home a  Rheumaticy old man (perhaps.) We are going  into the Somme again so I suppose it will  be quite warm enough in some ways. I can
assure you. I am ready for anything after  five months in blighty. Bob wants me to  apply for him to be sent Transferred to  my Batt as soon as he joins up his Regt  & I am going to do it although I know our  Batt is not much good I fancy it is better  than a good few of the others & I will do  my best for him although I don't suppose I  will be able to do much. South Australia  seems to have been having great to do about  Conscription. By jove some of them are needed  here alright. When I come back to the batt.  & it still is but a skeleton of a Batt. you said  in your letter that Col Dollman had been  sent home for a rest. I don't think he has  practically been ch cashiered for something he  did. I fancy it was cowardice but don't you  mention this to any one as I am not quite sure  about it Well Mum I will write about once a  week now that I am back & you will know  how I am getting along, so I must push off now  with love to Dad & Jack also yourself  & a kiss as well from,   X Wall.
