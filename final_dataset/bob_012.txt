Lemnos Island Harbour. 21.11.1915
Dear Mum, It is a great change from Egypt here the weather has been bitterly cold with gales of wind blowing we arrived here last Tuesday night & have been stuck on board in the one spot for 5 days doing nothing awaiting further orders. Have been playing a lot of auction bridge & every other game one can think of will be glad to get a move on now it is getting monotonous stuck in the one spot doing nothing. Had a rather exciting trip coming from Alexandria life boats all half lowered ready for trouble we picked up 4 boat loads from a ship that was casp sunk by a submarine 3 hours ahead of us & you can imagine things were only middling that day however we arrived here without any further trouble. There are all sorts of boats here from the Aquitania which is a hospital ship to the smallest destroyer it is great to see these ships dodging in & out protecting & convoying ships etc. Someone thought they had a better right to my blanket than myself last night so that when his nibs went to bed about 11 o'clock all I had was an overcoat and a waterproof sheet it was very cold & hard on the bare boards I expect someone else will be short tonight for I do not intend to be. All sorts of money is being offered for tobacco & cigarettes on board but the money is no good nothing to sell in that line hope they will stock up again if we are to stay here much longer. Well there is absolutely no more news this week but shall probably have some next letter All good wishes for a bright & merry Xmas & New Year lots of love Bob.
Have you heard from Nana yet? do not know where he is also have had no letter since September hope every thing is OK.
