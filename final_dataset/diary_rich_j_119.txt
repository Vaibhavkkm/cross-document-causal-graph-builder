March 27th.  Tuesday. Morning Parade:-- Lewis Gun. Firing Practice. Baths. Musketry. Afternoon:-- Company in Attack, (Practice). 1700 Col. Blamey, "Attack" (lecture). In attacking a single trench position the advancing party will be in one line. Should the artillery fail in their work or be required to do further work it would be almost 3 hours to get onto them. No "Moppers Up" are to be used in the Leap Frog system of attack. In the first line going through to the 2nd or 3rd objectives the "Moppers Up" will be about 1/3 of the attacking force. March 28th. Wednesday. Morning Parade:-- Field Firing (At moving targets). 
Lewis Gun. Stoppages (practice) Artillery formations. Afternoon Parade:-- Football match. This Lewis Gun practice is very good indeed. We must by now all have a good working knowledge of the Gun and its makeup. I find the gun is a wonderful weapon; the manner in which it is put together is splendid. Its uses in either defense or attack can be made very valuable, even more valuable than we had previously behind.
