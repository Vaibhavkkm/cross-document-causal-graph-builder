Belgium   06.07.1916.  Dear Mum, Well I hope your are well & getting   on alright , because I am still in the land   of the living Our raid came off alright about   4 nights ago. It was fairly successful we   killed about 20 Germans & we bought back   about 7 of them. I brought back one myself   I got a couple of photos from him & a pocket   book & several other items but I gave most   of the things in to Brigade H.Qs but I kept   the photos & I am sending them on with this   letter, I have marked the one I brought back   with a cross.  see that you don't lose these as   I would like to keep them but I think that   we will be getting plenty more soon as I   fancy that our big move is no more than   a week off. In fact two nights ago we were   all packed up ready for a change. I don't   know how we missed it. But they were   evidently not ready for it quite yet. but just   here where we are they are putting down 
railway lines & roads & just behind us they   have got over 100,000 cavalry ready to take up   the advance after we have taken the lines of   trenches. I can tell you it is no small   advance that we a going into. I can tell you   most likely before you receive this letter all   France will be ablaze & I think that there   will be no stopping this time in fact I   think that this advance that the British   are making is only a flash in the pan. I   think myself that all the fighting will be   from about #### to #### we   are now a #### I hope I am not on   that school at England when this advance   comes as I wouldn't be out of it for pounds.   Well mum I must close now with love   to all at home from your  Loving Son,  Wall xxxxx
