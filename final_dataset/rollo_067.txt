You can't imagine what a pleasure it is to have a cool meal in a cool place with comfortable seats. no flies, no dust, no sand or grit. Never is any meat pitched out now on a/c of being "off" - no more do we hear the old curses of the desert time - Our motto re Egypt & Sinai Penin. is "no Regrets" and a good one it is. (I will write more later) (June 17th- 16) It is marvellous the roundabout ways one takes nowadays to cross the Medit. I believe the R.N. sends countless instructions to transports, very few errors, detailing the course to be followed. Also (as there are about 5 ships in the convoy) all change their courses every five or six hundred yds so that it would be hard for a torpedo boat to make anything like accurate calculations from a sextant as to its rate, course, &c. in order to hit us. We passed around the N. of Crete, - a miserable mountainous island it looked.  In fact - everything pertaining to Greece is miserable, dirty, untidy, & damned.  The danger now (Adriatic) is not so much from shots as from mine-fields - undoubtedly the damned Greeks had a hand in laying them, & if Greece is the next country to be dealt with I hope the Aussies have a hand in dealing it out. The day before we l left the Canal I got a nice parcel from you - every article in it was acceptable
