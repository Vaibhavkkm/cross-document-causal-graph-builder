Copy of note recd. in Trenches by Capt Armitage during the stunt August 12 to 14.  Captain Armitage Please just tell your lads that they are most wonderful – and that although we are back here in comparative safety – we can appreciate the almost super-human efforts you are making. As for yourself & the other officers, if you could only hear how your wounded comrades speak of you and your pluck – you would be amply repaid for your sufferings . Good luck old boy. Stick to it for a little longer, & we will meet soon under better circumstances .  R . B . Jacob. Major 10th Battn
