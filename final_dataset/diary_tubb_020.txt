 Three of the 7th Machine Gun Section came out to see me yesterday. One of them J Whitelaw (Lt Whitelaw's batman) is being invalided to Australia (I intend sending some clothes home by him) Ridgeway & Middleton, the last named (shot through the knee) were here also. The 7th men Convalescents have difficulty in drawing pay at the Convalescent home, (through the fault of some of them drinking, & abusing the privileges there I believe) so they come out to me to draw pay for them. Received 149 piastres (my share of Regimental funds) this morning ... I am spending it on flour, rice raisins etc for the men! There are a number of Turkish prisoners taken to date. Many are on Lemnos - A German aeroplane flew over there the other day to bomb our troops camped there, but the bombs fell on the prisoners compound!!!
Promotions are many in the 6th Bn Capt Hogan Capt. Borwick have been made Majors, Lt Prisk Captain Lt Ulrick Captain Have not heard of 7th promotions yet! Orders are calling for applications from NCO's for commissions. Frank and I had a walk over the salt lake this evening discussing the matter Frank does not wish to leave the Bn so will not apply. It is strange that I we have heard nothing about our applications from HQrs yet! Col Marsh is leaving for the peninsula to day after recovering from an attack of rheumatism contracted  there some time ago. Col Marsh is the C.O. of the Divisional Train
