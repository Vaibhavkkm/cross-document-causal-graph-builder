Text:   Dear Father & Mother, The mail closes tomorrow but I will write a few lines now.  I put in for a job as a Staff Capt on a Bg. Staff - but no luck - my chance may come later Since my last I've had a big job (Staff - it was too) in entraining our whole Divy. away from Belgium to this place. - It took 23½ hours of continuous, strenuous work - but I got every man, horse, vehicle,  &c., away well up to time.  I came under notice of the Divn. Staff - so I now have a "leg in" for something. else later on. C. Co. doesn't seem the same. Beresford has been sent to Eng. to our Tng Bn with Major Herbert for 6 mos.  I made 'Beresford' an officer, same way as Giles did me. He fought alongside of me, & was a fine young chap, so I am very sorry to lose him - as he was reliable too. I couldn't part with Jim without feeling it very much, for a better man doesn't exist.  I have now no 'crony' of my own or superior rank - & the Bn seems strange. However we have to put up with it now - tho' it seems strange without Jim on parade. Well we are "near it again" - so no more news for awhile, & I'll close with much love & kindest regards to all especially yourselves Your loving son Rollo. Hope you're as well as I am.
