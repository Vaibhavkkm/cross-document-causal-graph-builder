Oct. 4th Sunday     No leave. Physical drill as usual at 6.30. but the bugle goes off at 5.30 Much to early.  Church parade looked very nice with only a broad leather belt & pouch. The Methodist service starts at 9.30 on the ground. The other denominations march out to the surrounding Churchs. I enjoyed the service and the singing. At 10.30 p.m. I cleared out against all orders and made for Manly and arrived later at Narrabeen in time for dinner with Miss Donaldson at the camp. At walk amongst maiden hair and pretty l   wild & violets with W.Z. from the hill just across the bridge The moonlight and evening effect were just life to me. I hurried miserably away from delightful Narrabeen at 9.16 arriving unseen  back in camp at 12 o'clock unobserved and safe.
