Things are getting very close to sailing.  these sea-kits have to be arranged by to-morrow. Our daily papers are hardly worth reading as they are all war cables and notes which never seems to agree one with another. I am disappointed at the tome of the press in attempting to belittle the ability of the Germans and accuse them of all kinds of muder murder and  plunder. The even accuse them of cowardice &c crime.
