November 24th.  Friday There has been nothing much doing today. In the afternoon I spent two hours dressing up some "greasy" heeled horses and then went off 3 kilos away to Ribemont to find out how Sid Middleton was, but failed as his battalion, 19th, have not yet come back from the firing line. I walked hard all the way back through Merricourt to camp and was pleased with the exercise having walked probably 12 kilometres at a strong pace. The night is not nearly so cold. I slept without even putting my head under the blankets, a habit I've got into since Gallipoli. Over in Gallipoli it was necessary to prevent the dirt from fretting away and falling on your face, as well as to keep out the sound of our own gun fire, or in the daylight sleeping after night work to keep out the strong light. In France the only occasion to do it is when sleeping near the firing line, but it also keeps one a little warmer when blankets are scarce, and then it drifts into a habit.
