On Active  Service  Mrs D Caldwell. Dudley St Semaphore Sth Aust.

5/11/15 Dear Mum,  Still alive & kicking & I  hope you are all the same at home.  we are still at the same place and  we are still marking time. I think  we will be shifting very shortly  away from this spot but you  never know. I did not have any  writing paper to write a letter to  you so I had to manage with this P.C. I have still got a few   P.C.s left so you must not expect  two many letters from me unless  I can manage to borrow some  from one of my chums but I  think that they are the same as  myself. I received your letter yesterday  & was sorry to hear Jack was out of  work but he was always too cheeky  to his bosses. I think it will be as  well if you can get him in the Railway  like Bob. love to all from, Wally.
