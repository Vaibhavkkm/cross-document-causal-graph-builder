Mena Camp. 25/12/14
 Dear Father & Mother Nearly every one has had more or less of a Xmas dinner. We provided 5 turkeys & a keg of beer for our Company. - - Part of the morning I spent in ascending the Great Pyramid – My knees were shaking when we got back from the strain. &c &c . we have been spending the past couple of days in making the camp tidy – All my company lines are now marked out in white stones on the sand & several of the tents have made weird devices & designs of the same in front of their tents. They have been much admired by some of the other companies. I attended Divine Service this morning - the Dean officiated. The parsons complain of not being able to get hold of the men & when they get a chance, as today with about 2500 or 3000 men they seem to do their best to make as dull a show as possible. The men can barely hear, others have to stand the whole time in the blazing sun. The soldiers spend their money freely - & as the pay bill must be about £100,000 per week you can realize the record season - H.G. Carter
