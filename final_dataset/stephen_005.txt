 Dear Mrs Allen,  As I have been  away in England wounded  I only received Miss Allen's  letter yesterday so please  excuse my delay in replying  I am extremely sorry that  I am unable to give you  much hope as regards  your two sons. On the night  of August 14th the 13th  Battalion in conjunction  with other regiments made  an attack on that  famous German stronghold  Mouquet Farm. It was  one of the most glorious  charges in which the  Australians have participated  as the machine gun fire which  they were called upon to face  was terrific. Our lads got  right across but their 
And as regiments on our  flanks failed we had to  retire. We brought back a  number of Germans prisoners  and most of our own  wounded. There was a  faint possibility that your  two sons were taken  prisoners consequently they  were posted as missing  but if you have not yet  received intimation that  they are in German  hands I think you must  make up your own mind that  they fell gallantly, while  pushing forward in that  glorious charge. All those  that were left of the  10th reinforcements (there  are very few now) were  extremely sorry that the  two brothers were gone.  They were like by  all ranks and were  good soldiers and willing  losses were very heavy
fighters. Although they  have given up their lives  they did their duty nobly  and well. Please accept  my deepest sympathy.  Yours very sincerely  T. Willis, Captain  13th Battalion. A.I.F   P.S. Your boys, if killed,  will have been buried  along with a large number  of their Australian comrades  on the field of battle,  near Mouquet farm, which is about a mile from  Pozieres.
