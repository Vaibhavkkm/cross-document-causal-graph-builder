Troop Ship "Minnewaska" January 9th, 1916.  Dear Mum, I hope you are all very well at home & getting on alright as I am in the best of health - We are one our way from Lemnos to some-where or other. but I think it is Egypt. I expect this will be about the first letter you will have  received for about 6 weeks. They would not let us write any letters for over a month on Lemnos & there weren't any letters sent away from Gallipoli for about a fortnight before we left. I suppose the people in Australia were wild when they heard we had to evacuate the Peninsula after losing so many lives there. I think we are going to organise in Egypt again & then I suppose we will be off again. It was pretty rotten about Ev's sister dying especially having all those children & Ev is a soon to go knocking herself out looking after the children but I suppose she wants to do it so that is
the end of it. We are having a splendid trip over the boat is about a 16,000 tonnes & can do about 20 knots an hour & it is good tucker & plenty of it. I can tell you I am enjoying myself. I have still got my job of C.S.M. but I suppose I will lose it when we get to Egypt & the other chap comes back but I don't mind as he is a pal of mine The old Geelong got torpedoed the other day somewhere near where we are now. They have got a good few boats in these seas. There is such a lot of islands about here, I hope g we get into action again shortly as I want to get up to the top of the tree & I havn't got much chance while we are training, although I may get a chance as R.S.M. one of these fine days & that is next door to getting a Commission. I must close now with love to all from   XXXX Your loving Son, "Wally"
