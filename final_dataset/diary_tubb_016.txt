Anniversary of Waterloo I suppose some fierce fights will be taking place to day. Col Harris Hancock inspected horses that have been put aside for carting here to day, several of our Bde were passed for carting they are to be replaced by mules - I am glad that all my horses are fit! Received a letter from Little Collins St this morning. Have heard that grand rains have fallen in Victoria. Hear that Gen Legg from Australia the new G.O.C. in place of our late General Bridges has arrived(!)
