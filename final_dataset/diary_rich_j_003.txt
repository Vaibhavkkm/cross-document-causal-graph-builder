Monday  Oct 5th They smother up the roll call in my favour yesterday, and instead of trouble to. day, I am clear & free. It was, however, a big risk. We all marched in good order for about 8 miles out around Marowbra arriving back to camp at 5.35. The back section of the 3 had a lot of trouble in picking up the correct step, due considerable to the fact that our officers are such bad, short stepped and rambling marchers. But the average soldier as far as my experience goes with the A.M.C., is a arrargent conceited and boastful person, "superb grand stand players." Alway judging their standard of manhood by the worst man in the squad. The Englishmen mostly are a loud voiced, empty inconsiderate lot and can be easily picked out by their stiff and bound up movements. No leave to night but I went & had tea with Cis Sponza.  Picket duty from 11 to 1.30. a.m. 

Obligatory Calls Scouts' call Alarm Charge Orders Warning for Parade Quarters Bugle Fall in Rations Scouts dinner Reveillé Last Post Dismiss Light out
