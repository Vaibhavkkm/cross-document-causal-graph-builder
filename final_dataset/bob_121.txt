My dear Mum, It is snowing like fun much too heavily to do anything but stay in ones tent and freeze. Another Xmas has passed on this side of the world and under the circumstances very pleasantly.  Although we are just behind the front line yet we managed to give every one a good dinner and plenty to drink . A pair of socks some cigarettes & sweets were also issued to each man from the Comforts Fund. We had Soup Roast Mutton Roast Turkey Plum Pudding Prunes & rice nuts etc for dinner & Whisky Port Sherry & beer to drink after such a dinner you can imagine the fun we had fighting in the snow. I was in an awful mess had to thaw in front of a fire for about an hour.  still it was
fine sport. It is rumoured we will be out again for the New Year and if so expect to run big sports & have a real jolly time  there is an officers hack race 4 furlongs coming off  I am going to run ride my pony and guess I shall give them a go for it. Expect Nana is back from leave by this have not been able to look him up yet he is away behind us somewhere sure to run across his crowd about the New Year Absolutely no news for you at present shall write again soon lots of love to all, Bob.
