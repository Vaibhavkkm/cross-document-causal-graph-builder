D Coy 9th Scottish Cadet  Battalion  Gailes Ayrshire Scotland     3/8/1916.  Dear Mum,   Well you see by this that   I have got to the O.T.C. at last. I don't   know yet whether I will pass the   doctor though on account of my arm.  I will know before I finish this   letter & I will add it on to the end.   I hope I pass through now that we   have got this far.Our chaps have been   fighting pretty hard in France since I   left there. & they have been losing pretty   heavily. I sent home to you to send   Blanche 10 pounds. You see we had a   fortnight in London & that ran away   with some money & I wanted some to carry   on down here with. so I got some from   Blanche & sent if you can send some on   to her. I will make it up as soon as I   get back & get a chance to. We are   stationed about 10 miles from where dads '   people live so you may be sure that   I will look them up shortly. I am   going to try & get leave tomorrow night. 
It is a very nice place up here we are   quite close to the sea & we are well fed.   I can tell you that I will be getting   as fit as a fiddle quite shortly. I weigh   over 11 stone now, so you see I am getting   quite a size. They are very strict here &   I can tell you it hurts cleaning up   buttons & equipment all the time. We   have to wear Tommy uniforms & I can   tell you they are all brass buttons.   I hope the two boys are keeping well   & not giving you too much trouble.   Blanche is as happy as Larry over here.   I can tell you she is having quite a   time of it. Give Ev my love when   you see her again. I will also give   her some when I write today (not arf).   Well mum I must close today with love to all  xxxx  from your Loving Son,  Wall.
