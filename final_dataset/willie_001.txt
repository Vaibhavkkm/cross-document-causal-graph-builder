Before posting this, I might say that we did land, & have  safely arrived at our destination. Our post is a very easy & comparative safe one, where we can get good shelter behind a high ridge, & our trenches are also good, deep - & commanding a rare stretch  of enemies country. I am having a fairly good time, & find life full of interest here - these are interesting times are they not? We can see a long way around us, & at night the bursting shells from our ships can be plainly seen from here. The bombs, & star shells are also interesting too watch from a distance:  & we can hear the noises of engagements from various posts, both far & near: As we shall be getting some cold weather here soon, we have to dig well into the hill for our  'dugouts' but we hope to get to Constantinople for the winter! - Anything you would like from there? it is noted for its 'harems' but whatever they are, so may bring one of them back with me. Hope you are well. Love to all, Will.
