  Dearest Mother, just a line to let you know that I am getting on fine, I suppose you have been wondering if I have been sick; well, I have, 3 times, but I haven't 'missed a meal yet.' We are living like lords, and the food is splendid It is the confounded smell of the horse boxes that upsets my poot stomach, it smells so beastly sour, & you know what the Ellsworth "nose" is. We stay at Albany 10 days before we leave for England The Stewdards are good fellows and look after us well, I always have two goes at the soup. It is Henley Day today, & I was thinking that if someone had said last Henley Day that I would be on the way to England next Henley Day, I would have said "Rats" There is not much to write about, mother, so will close with fondest Love to George Mab, Rupert, Miss Taylor, Jack all kind enquirers & especially to your dear self with fondest Love again Your Loving Son Norman.

return to Mary when you have read them Hannah 1st letter
