be able to tear myself away from London yet. However that remains to be seen.  Shall have a look around London tomorrow and try & buy some decent present to send home for Xmas hope you get it all right shall also cable from here tomorrow telling you I am on leave &  ok. Most fortunate this time the Batn have just gone into action and I have just come on leave very nice too still I have been in everything since j reforming so deserve a rest Must try and see George and get my MC medal presented this trip of course and shall be very busy having a good time & seeing people alas the time is all too short Shall write again soon lots of love to all Bob.
