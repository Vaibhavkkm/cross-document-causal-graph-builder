Gaba Tepe 30th June 1915   Dearest Mother & all at Home Just a brief note to let you know that I am quite well, & hope you are the same. We are still holding this place without any trouble whatever, & waiting for the retreating Turks from the South & then we will mow them down with our shrapnel & lyddite. They have made lyddite for our 18 pounders now, & we stir the Turks gun pits & trenches up with it, its just lovely. Down at Cape Helles, it is our incessant bombardment night & day & they simply have to be shelled out of concrete trenches. The Turks are in honeycombs in the hill down there & the British are going to blow it up. My gun fired 10 rounds at a Turks gun on Tuesday afternoon & put it out of Action. It was a little dud as they put a few high explosive round about us, but they can't shoot for nuts. Well, mother, dear, Ive not much news this time. I hope all are well. Give my love to all & thank all kind enquirers after me. Tell them to be proud of the Australian Infantry I have got all the socks & handkerchiefs which you so kindly sent me. Well good-bye for the present with fondest love to all from Norman
