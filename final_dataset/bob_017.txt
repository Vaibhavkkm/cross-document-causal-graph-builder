Ismailia 17-1-1916 My dear Lorna, Received the two parcels you sent many thanks for same everything is very useful and deeply appreciated. Have spent the last few days in the hospital here suffering from septic sores on both legs. nothing at all serious having a great time and shall be all right again in a few days It is indeed nice to get clean and have a decent bed. am making the most of the rest I can assure you. Tell Mick Mr Richardsons cousin wrote to Nana and is also writing to me and by his letter which
is a very nice one if we go to London and let him know when we arrive we are in for the time of our lives His address is Kileena West by Fleet Surrey. Among other things he says that “his heart goes out to any & all that are fighting for the right as on the 7th inst I lost my elder son at Subba Silla Suvla Bay” seems to be a real good sort and shall not forget to let him know should the opportunity occur. Have absolutely no news this week Nana came in to see me yesterday he is very well & getting as fat as a pig. Plenty to read here and games play a lot of bridge also get up and sweep up the ward carry meals & odd jobs to fill in the time.
This hospital game is all right for about a week but should say it would be an awful bore to be confined in one any longer. Had a long letter from Jane dated 14th Nov. glad to hear all the news will address this c/o of home have forgotten your address especially the name of the house. Tell Jane the small note to Jim Cooney was not enclosed in her letter However poor Jim is away in Malta sick have not seen him since leaving Egypt. Norman Rollo is at Heliopolis I believe shall certainly look him up if I have the pleasure of going to Cairo again Janey must be a bonny kid now would love to see her best of love to all Bob.
