France  19/6/1916  Dearest Jennie  A line to let you know I've still  got a kick in me.  Things have been  pretty lively round here just  lately & we are going into  rest for 28 days shortly.  This item is   just about all the news there  is to tell.  Ever tried to write  a letter when there is nothing  to talk about? I tell you its  a great game. I've been sitting  here for the last 5 minutes trying  to find something to say;  but can't  Ah! happy though. The weather  has been very bad since I got
back here;  but the last two  days have been dry;  though  still very cold.  It doesn't seem  5 weeks since I got back, but  it is, & I'll soon be looking  for more leave.  You see I will   be running home again before  "no time".  Has Ernie R been able  to get his passport yet?  I  hope he does, it will mean so  much to them. & its a lovely  climate for children.  How are all the inhabitants  of the Nest keeping?  Mother doesn't   mention health at all in her last  letter. I sent Dad a pocket  book per hand a day or two  ago. Hope he received it safely  & that you like the bearer.
If this reaches you in time  As him if he remembers our  last feed on Russells Top.  I bet he smiles. It was   some feed, I tell you.  Soup (Pea) Fish (Sardines) Aintree  (Machonochi Ration Stew) Poultry (Tinned Chicken)  very tough  Sweets (Tinned Peaches & Pears)  & Ideal milk. Bread Butter cheese  coffee. Hows that for active service  Oh! I forgot Licquer (Rum.)  I don't know who's birthday  it was now. We had menu cards  (old postcards) & all signed our  autographs. I lost mine somewhere   when we made our last move.  It was an interesting  souvanier.  I must cease my chatter  now as its nearly 4 o'clock (A.M.)
& I must turn in.  Give me love to   Mother & Dad & keep heaps  for your own dear self.  Good-night God bless  & guard you all  Ever your loving old brother  Ernie
