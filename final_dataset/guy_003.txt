Gallipoli  8 November 1915   My dear Father,  Thanks  very much for your long  letter which I received yesterday;  you don't seem to   have received my letter  telling you we were having  a spell at Lemnos Island,  we were there just two  months, we did not have  a bad time, we did  a certain amount of drill
every day, such as sham  fights, & also bomb throwing  & bayonette drill; we had  two hours of that every  day, & towards the end   we used to get silent  marches at night; we used  to average about one  mile an hour, & then we  could pick our way  carefully, without kicking   stones etc.  We are back on the  Peninsula again now,  we have taken up a  different position in  the trenches, to what we  left, I like the position  better, as we are not subject  to such heavy shell fire,  & there is a very deep  gully in between our trenches  & the turks, called the Gully  of Despair & very rightly   too, as I think it would   be very deadly for either  side to attack in this   particular position, unles  it was done under cover  of darkness, & then of course  we are very much on
the alert. We have patrols  go out at night, creep up as   near as possible to the   Turks Lines, to get as much  information as possible, of  course the Turks are up  to the same game.  Ken was lucky getting to   London; he will be able  to give you a better idea   of how things are here  than I can on paper.  Do you hear very often from   Rupert; I suppose he is keeping  an eye on burns Creek Farm,  just to see how things are getting  on.  With love  Your affection son, Guy Arnold.


Wishing you a very happy  Xmas only wish I  could be with you,  it is a long long time  since we had the last Xmas together.
