Egypt 14.5.1916  Dear Mick Seems to me that it is some considerable time now since I addressed a letter to you Received your letter dated 30th March a couple of days ago and was glad to hear all the news it contained. Do not worry about business matters at all & do not think I am doing so at this end. Have not sent your letter through to Nana yet but will do so at the first opportunity he is out at the trenches again so have not seen him for about 3 weeks Last Friday the Pardre wanted to know if any of us would like to be confirmed I found out that it meant a day off also a trip to Suez and the evening was to be conducted by the Bishop of Jerusalem so decided to become Church of England and make the trip. Three other officers from the battalion & myself left here about 10 o'clock in the morning riding to Serapeum station from there catching the train to Suez, a distance of some 40 miles We arrived there at lunch time went to a Pub had lunch and at 3 o'clock in the afternoon went to the Church & through the service I enjoyed the service immensely although it was very solemn it was a treat to go & sit down again in a nice cool Church with an organ for music There were 25 present we being the only Australians The Bishop is a real sport and an exceptionally nice man some-where about 50 yrs of age we all met him after the service he then took us to afternoon tea at the Pub and had a yarn to each of us After tea we had half an hour so got a garry and drove around we arrived back at Serapeum at 7-30pm and had a ride back to camp in a violent dust storm which was the ending of a very hot day the temperature during the day being 117° However I enjoyed the whole day besides meeting the Bishop of Jerusalem and being confirmed by him seeing Suez and getting away from the desert if only for a few hours Yesterday in camp was even hotter than the day before We knocked off for the day at 8-30 in the morning. Spent most of the day playing bridge then about 7 o'clock went into dinner in my silk pyjamas that I brought from Australia of course I got a cheer but was generally envied by all it was terribly hot and I was the most comfortable which we is not saying much However my pyjamas seemed to send every body mad for after dinner everyone got into some sort of fancy dress, swimming costumes, pyjamas of all colors etc we then visited the 16th mess sang songs & had a drink & invited them up on the way back called on the 14th mess had a drink & invited them up then looked the 4th field ambulance up & brought them along. All assembled in the 13th mess we had some drinks & speeches & songs about 60 of us all together 4 cases of beer & several bottles of whisky being consumed bye the bye Jack Cosgrove & Rupert Furber are with the 4th Field Ambulance had a  long yarn to Rupert he has only been over here at short time Every officer who was not present was brought in from bed and every bodys shirt taken off It was a great evening and very funny will leave to your imagination what things would be like about 60 officers from Colonels downwards all stripped bar shorts singing, giving speeches & generally going mad it was quite a relaxation after the intensely hot day. The weather is cooler to-day but very dusty & unpleasant We are taking our lunch down to the canal & spending the day in the water it will be quite like Thirroul again shall tell you about it in the next letter. We have no orders yet but I expect to leave here for France at any time now. Cheers kid best of love to all Bob
