Text:  Dear Father & Mother, We have had another shift since I last write, a little nearer the Front and we are real innocents at present - catching all the spare that the enemy tosses over at our Artillery.  I don't think Fritz has any special malice against infantry in billets near Artillery pits - but I am certain he has a down on Artillery - so we get much of what was meant for other people. It is a horrible sensation to see tiles flying off one's roof - I've endured that, - but others have been less fortunate. I've seen the whole roof shifted by one shell.  Fritz is very busy with his guns - but Jacko took the beach as far as effective work went - Beachy Bill alone gave us over 1000 casualties on Anzac Beach - Fritz has no gun to compare with that. Major Herbert & I are together with our H.Q. in the same billet, our companies are spread out  garrisoning various places - so what pretty long days we have walking round visiting our details.  Herbert is one of the best, an ideal C.O. & it would be grand if the A.I.F. had more like him.
I ran across a lot of the 11th Battalion Was very pleased to see me, congratulated me, & sends
