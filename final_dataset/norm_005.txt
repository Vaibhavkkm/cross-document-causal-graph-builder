 Sunday 22nd November, 1914.  Dear Mother & all at home. I have been wondering how you are all getting on, and I hope for the best. Did you get my previous letter from Colombo?. We were only allowed to write one letter & they censor all our letters before sending. We were not allowed to land there, but by the sight we all saw from our anchorage, it is a beautiful place. All the natives in different coloured garbs & English people in white, & Rickshaws everywhere. All the houses are without chimneys & they are very large & look like "Paying Guest" houses. Lawns & Palm trees & Cocoa nut trees predominate. Natives in funny boats made out of a couple of planks came out to us & dive for money, they wont dive for coppers only silver, but we used to wrap half pennies up in silver paper & throw it in & then to see the fight as they dived for it, & then the bad language as they discoverd the fraud, they can stay under water for a very long time. We stayed for 4 days there whilst we took in water. Did I describe the fight the Sydney had with the Emden? I think I did. We still have a lot of battleships with us, but there is no danger now as all the Enemy are  Give my kindest regards to Miss Taylor & that I hope she is well 
are accounted for. The other night, our Japanese warboat signalled to the cruiser "Melbourne" that these was a light out on the horizon & was going out to see, & altho' the Melbourne was right on the other side of us, she came tearing through between us & the next boat behind us at 30 knots an hour & raced the Jap out to it, but there was nothing doing because they were both back in 10 minutes. Now for the most exciting part of the voyage. Don't be frightened. We have been in a collision with the Steamer "Ascanius" at 4 o'clock yesterday morning The Ascanius was sailing 500 yards in rear of us & the boat in front of us stopped & we stopped & signalled to the back boats, but she didn't see our signal & ran into our stern & then up alonside of us & gave us another bash in the side. We were all in bed, of course, but I was awake, & heard our engines stop, & afterwards came the bump. All the horses on deck nearly all fell, & of course we wondered what had happened, & I knew that it wasn't much of a bump, but shortly afterwards the second bash came, & then the alarm bell sounded, I grabbed my life belt & got my pants on & got on deck & there was the Ascanius right alongside & one could have jumped aboard. It is a peculiar feeling because one doesn't realise what has happened, & our whistle was blowing furiously & we were sending up Rockets. Every body fell in in their proper positions with life belts on. Then came the warships tearing down to us at full speed & with their searchlights on us & made everything as light as day; Our damage was only slight & above the water line so we were 
able to go on. The Captain was that pleased with our conduct that he has reported it to the Higher Authorities 5 of our boats have left the main division & gone on to Aden at 14 knots per hour, the others are only doing 10 knots. We expect to arrive in Southampton on 18 of December & go into Barracks for 6 months. Everybody is getting sick of the voyage & will be glad to get off the boat as it stinks of Horses. The voyage has been very calm & very little sickness prevails except through innoculation which makes one very sick for 2 days or more. My mate Saddler Sergeant Jack Hall says that he wishes he could go into a trance & wake up when we get to England. Tell Mabel that sea voyages are rotten & I wish I could get my horse ashore & ride overland for the rest of the distance. How is George getting on in his business;? I hope successfully. I hope you are quite well & all at home. How is Charlie & Hettie & family.? Give them my love. Write to Aunt Hannah & tell her my news as I am not allowed to write more than 2 letters this mail. & please get Jack to write to Winchelsea & tell them that I am quite well & hope all are well & that I cannot write at present, but when I get to England I will do so. & Please write to Constable D Watson of Royal Mint & tell him my news & give him my best wishes & to all the boys there too. No more news at present so with best Love to all & Rupert also Believe me your loving Son Norman.


Tell Jack that the first Motor Car I saw in Colombo was a Ford 4th letter
