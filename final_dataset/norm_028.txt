Text:    Gaba Tepe  May 6th 1915     Dearest Mother & all at Home  Just a line to  let you know that I am in the best of  good health & spirits & I am pleased to  say that all the boys are too. We  landed last Sunday week under  tremendous fire from our battleships  & what a sight it was too: One I  shall never forget. The Turks simply  flew in all directions. The Infantry  landed first & had to drive the Turks  from some of the biggest & most  rug   rugged hills imaginable & they  have done wonderful in doing so.  I landed with my Subsection in  the afternoon & got our gun up on a  hill & at once got to work. We were  under shrapnel fire from 3 different  directions & we soon located a 6 gun  battery shelling us & we swung  round on to them & put them  completely out of action by 18 shots 
The Infantry had had a bad time  from the Turks shrapnel but it  put fresh heart into our boys &  as our shrapnel is larger than  theirs, they won't stand up to it.  We are in a very safe position  & are well "dug in" & the shrapnel  can't touch us.  We have had  only 3 of our chaps slightly hit  by spent bullets. Jack Heywood  got hit by a shrapnel bullet in  the leg & has gone on board the   Hospital Ship. It is not at all  serious & he was sent there as we  have no accommodation on the beach.  The "Queen Elizabeth" with her  15 inch guns, is doing great work  & the noise is deafening when she  fires the 8 together. The Australian  & New Zealand Troops are all  doing magnificently & have proved  themselves that they are not the the 6/- a day tourists that "stay at  home" critics say they are. They  wont come out of the trenches even  for a spell & when the Royal  Marine Light Infantry were sent  to relieve them, they all went back  again after an hours spell.  The weather is delightful & we   should soon be on our way to  Constantinople. My boys are real  tricks & think it great sport. Our  horses are going back to Alexandria  tomorrow & this letter goes with them.  We go for a swim each evening  so don't do too bad. Our food is  splendid & plentiful. The men  in the trenches are well fed, etc, &  all their stuff is carried by mules  who have proved to be wonderful.  The warships bombard night &  day & it plays havoc with the   Turks
 I am writing this in our "dug out"  & it is getting dark, so excuse my   bad writing & mistakes. Jack Hall  & Braithwaite are still on the  boat & have not been ashore yet   so do not know what it is like  to be under fire yet.  Now Mother, dont worry  about me, as I am perfectly  safe & know how to look after  myself. This game suits me to  a "T" & I am thoroughly in my   glory. Hope all are well  Give my love to all at home &  accept same from your  loving & happy son  Norman.
