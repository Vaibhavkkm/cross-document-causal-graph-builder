Moascar, March 9th, 1916  Dear Mum. Well I hope this finds you quite well & having a fair time I am well. We are still down here on the canal but expect to shift to France within the next couple of days. I  suppose we will get it pretty hot over there. well I suppose that is what we came for so we will have no cause for complaint I have been confirmed in my rank of Sgt Major now so you can address my letters accordingly. I suppose I will get up the ladder gradually I am still hoping for something higher & we have got a good O.C. so he may make a bit of f difference. Well old girl I must close with love from your loving son, "Wally"  XXXX
