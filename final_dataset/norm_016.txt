Text:    Dearest Mother & all at Home  I suppose that you will be  somewhat surprised to know that I have just had a   spell of 5 days in the 1st Australian General Hospital  at Heliopolis (4 miles the other side of Cairo). Last Sunday  we had a visit of 2 Egyptian Friends to the Mess & they  invited us to come into Cairo to tea with them, so with  Dowsett & Braithwaite, I went with them in their Car &  as we had not been to Heliopolis before, the chauffeur  ran us out to there. My eyes felt a trifle sore all  day, but as this is not unusual on account of the dust,  I took little notice of it, but by the time we reached  Heliopolis, my eyes were almost completely closed & large  quantities of matter was running from there & as they  were so painful, Braithwaite took me across to the   Hospital (just opposite) & here I was fortunate to meet Dr  J.W. Barrett. (Occulist & Aurist) who had just arrived  with the second contingent & he treated me immediately  & gave me wonderful relief, but said he would keep  me for a few days & told Braithwaite to inform our  commanding officer of the fact. Well I was given  a lovely hot bath & put to bed with clean sheets Etc  & there I spent 5 lovely days amid pleasant surroundings.
This hospital has only just opened that day & I had  the distinction of being the first patient & didn't the  nurses treat me well too. My word, Mum, the Australian  girls are the best after all, they treated me  tip-top & what do you think, a sister told me that  she was born in Smeaton, Vic, her name is  Sister Anderson. Well this place was built as an  Hotel & cost 2 millions & it was intended to rival  Monte Carlo, but the Egyptian Govt would not grant  them a gambling liscence, & they tried to run it as  a Hotel, but it failed this year, so the British Govt  snapped it as a hospital. It is a wonderful  place & beautifully lit up & it costs £70 a night  for electric lighting. It is the 2nd largest Hotel in  the world. Well my eyes used to be bathed every  3 hours with boracic & drops put in & this gave  me wonderful relief. Dr Barrett is a gentlemen &  & is so nice & nothing gives him trouble & he can't  do enough for his patients. He lives in Toorak.  The nurses also waited on me day & night  & couldn't do enough for me, & their one object is to  serve their country. All the chaps at camp, especially  my subsection, were astonished when they learnt  next morning that I was in the Hospital, as I 
was on the 4 o'clock parade with them & yet I was  in the Hospital at 5.30 pm. The pain & inconvenience  that I suffered was completely compensated for by  the welcome that the boys gave me when I returned  to camp completely cured. It was some sort of Opthalmia  & the Dr  said that I probably contracted it from a  horse with a cold. We haven't had a "box on" yet with  the Turks, altho' the Victorian Infantry is down there  at the Canal doing well, but we hope to be there  soon. Mabs cigarettes arrived 2 days ago & in good  condition & the boys send their heartiest thanks &  good wishes to her for her kindness. How is Rupert.  That is always on my mind at present, but something  tells me he is alright now, anyhow, I hope so.  The whole of the Divisional Artillery had their  photo taken this morning & it was a fine sight & I'll  try & send you a Photo if I can. How is every body in  Melbourne. I hope quite well. Give all kind enquirers   my best wishes, & my best love to all at Home.  There is nothing much to tell you, as we are still  doing the same kind of work, but we hope to get a  shift soon. Well Mother, dear, I'll close now in  order to catch the Mail with best love & hoping all  are well I am your loving son, Norman.

I think I will be  successful in getting  Percy Wells (May Tiltons  friend) transferred into  our Battery.  He is with the  Ammunition Column
