13th November 1917.  My dear General May I offer you my very best congratulations on your new promotion and the recent high honour - I did not know of either when I saw you the other day - & did not say anything about them. You know how we all feel that these things have been very late in coming to you 
and how delighted everybody is that at last you are getting things you have deserved for so long. I hope you are going. to take a little time off now - you have had a very strenuous time, and you need a short rest at any rate.
My wife sends her best congratulations to Lady Birdwood - Yours sincerely - C.M.Wagstaff.
