17-10-1918. My dear mother, I must try to set out for your benefit the rather interesting experiences we have had during the past month as it is just a month ago today since we left our camp in the olive trees. When I wrote you from there I was of course aware that operations were coming on but could not divulge anything in my letters as the strictest secrecy was observed. It was however most interesting to watch the preparations for the offensive which entailed a vast amount of work & upon which the success of the action largely depends. You remember when I told you of our leaving the Jordan Valley for a spell - in reality we moved right across near to the sea & there hid for a month among some very large orchards & olive groves admirably suited for the purpose. Then the men trained hard as they had just been given swords for the first time & there we equipped & prepared for operations. Then as the days drew on we watched the gradual piling up of troops in this area - all done secretly - & so complete was our air mastery that I only once  saw a hostile aeroplane trying to spy out our intentions. I have never seen such a concentration of troops & artillery at one spot. Then one night we got into our allotted positions behind the infantry & then with a pouf!  bang! at 4 o'clock in the morning the avalanche was launched at the astonished Turk. He had concentrated the large part of his force in the Jordan valley & his line was comparatively weakly held. The preliminary bombardment lasted only for an hour or two & then the infantry went over & through the Turk with few casualties & when they had broken the line our turn came & we were sent forward to our previously allotted tasks with the utmost rapidity How we went!!!! The advance mounted troops must have covered 35 miles that day. The pace was frequently a trot, sometimes a gallop. The whole object was to get round to the enemy's rear before he got away. You see we had broken his line near the sea & then dashed up the coast for a certain distance then turned to the right & crossed a range of mountains by the only decent pass & reached the plain of Esdraelon just about ½ hour before the Turks who were coming along to hold the pass succeeded in reaching it. Then on to El Afulah the main railway junction & later to Nazareth. Our little lot however when we crossed the pass turned to the Southeast & made for Jenin where the road from Nablus comes out on to the plain of Esdraelon & first is the head of the column of the Turks retreating from Nablus entered the place from the South entered the town from the South, our boys sword in hand galloped into it from the North. What consternation there was - 7000 Turks & Germans surrendered to a Regiment!!! When they saw how many they had taken our fellows were afraid they might not be able to hold them. The rest of the Brigade had come up then & another one was sent across at the gallop to help. Coming along next day I was astounded at the spectacle of so many prisoners with their peculiar forms of transport. Some were walking, some riding in coaches or funny old Turkish carts, some on camels, some on donkeys, all very tired, thirsty & dejected. The Germans looked infinitely superior to the Turk. Say what we will of them - I have found a good deal to admire in those we have seen here - they are sturdy hard working & well disciplined & fight like tigers in a comer. There is no love lost between them & the Turk, they live apart & always have separate hospitals & Ambulances & the German more or less despises the Turk & as far as I can see the Turk hates the German. But I must tell you my own personal experiences before arriving at Jenin. I had direct control over the motor Ambulances of our own Division & took them round to our starting point & left them there for further orders as the route we were taking was across country which was sandy & practically roadless & I didn't  like risking them over it. So Col Fowler my acting chief & I set off in a light car to explore it taking with us a motor bicycle to send back word to the Motor Ambulance whether to come on or not. We soon decided that it was not fit for our cars & decided to wait keep them back until Tul Keram had fallen & then send them along the main metalled road through it. We had broken the line on the seaward side, the defences in front of Tul Keram being then unbroken but our line was to swing round & take Tul Keram from the flank & then the main metalled road would be available for us. So I gave orders for the Ambulance to wait until Tul Keram had fallen & then proceed up the metalled road & meet me there. Col Fowler & I pushed on & reached the W. Iskanderuneh that night & he proceeded on with the Division while I waited till morning to collect any medical personnel & wheeled vehicles which might be stranded about there & direct them on. I found plenty of them as the heavy sandy going had been even too much for the horse drawn vehicles & they had great trouble in getting through. I collected what I could & sent them on, & then rode across to Tul Keram about 8 miles East of where I was to pick up the Motor Ambulances. Tul Keram was in a horrid mess - the remains of the battle were everywhere, dead Turks & horses, horseless vehicles, packs of abandoned transport - in one place about 300 wagons in a transport park, prisoners tired thirsty woebegone trooping in by their hundreds - wounded & sick going to hospital derelict trains in the station & lots of rolling stock, with the contents of the trucks & carriages scattered about the station yard in fact all the features which one now associates with the first day of a captured town The enemy usually destroys his wells & there is a day or two of water shortage till it can be remedied everyone is busy with his own work & at first all is confusion until this is superseded by the calm orderliness of army workings - each man to his own task & order supervenes on out of chaos. My Motor Ambulances did not turn up until almost evening but I then set off with them in chase of the Division reaching Khas Sumrah that night where we camped & made our evening meal. I slept well wrapping my mosquito net about my head as it was a very mosquito haunted & malarious spot & started off after an early breakfast at 6 a.m. next day. We left the coastal plain at Sumrah turning sharply East & crossed the range of hills which runs up from the mountain range about Nablus & Jerusalem to Haifa & divides the coastal plain which runs down through Jaffa & Ludd x the plain of Sharon from the plain of Esdraelon which lies on the other side of this range & which is watered by the brook Kishon of the Bible. We gradually mounted the range & entered a narrow defile which our troops had crossed 24 hours previously & which the rapidity of our advance had prevented the Turks from holding - & just as well as it would have been a very strong position - & finally reached the top & had our first glimpse of the plain of Esdraelon. It is a marvellous plain running from the sea right down to the Jordan & surrounded by hills on both sides - those round Nablus to the South & those round Nazareth to the North. Mount Tabor (the Mount of Transfiguration & where also Napoleon fought a great battle, rises abruptly out of the plain as a rounded hill. Nazareth lies in the hills to the North & is plainly visible from the plain. I found our headquarters at El Lejjun & after consultation with Col Fowler proceeded straight on to Jenin in a S.E. direction. Then I found my old Ambulance with it's quarters in a German Hospital & I took over control of the general medical organisation of the town. There were four Turkish hospitals filled with sick & wounded Turks - mostly malaria cases, several Turkish doctors & a good many orderlies. The German hospital had a German doctor in charge, a number of German orderlies & 11 German sisters - trained nurses who had been at Nablus & had attempted to escape by Jenin but were caught there. Then we had our own Ambulance with a few sick & wounded. The difficulty was to feed the Turks & Germans about 400 in all & all short of rations, but I managed to get some grain; had a mill & bakery started & got some bread delivered. Then I requisitioned 10 sheep & got rid of the shadow of starvation. We also located a drug store & a sufficiency of drugs & dressings in it. The next thing was to get more medical orderlies as the Turks were short - these we managed to get from among the prisoners. I took for myself an office a fine room in the front of the Turkish hospital & had a bed rigged up there with nice clean things on it & thought everything fine. But goodness! when I lay me down to sleep the fleas started & nearly eat me alive & in the end I had to bolt & sleep in an adjacent garden. I never experienced such fleas. Things were now going fairly well. The Turkish hospital was run by their Senior officer whom I had put in charge, the German hospital by their own doctor & our own Ambulance by its Senior officer & each daily rendered to me their returns & numbers in hospital so that I might ration them from local resources. We found large stores of Turkish bully beef a good deal of champagne & a soda water factory. So our patients were fairly well off & ourselves too for that matter. I had a very busy time but it was enjoyeable. After 3 days I received word to join the Division & leave the place in charge of Col Stuart & I then proceeded  to El Afuleh where the Division then was & found them living fairly comfortably in the railway buildings there. Afuleh was, as I have said their main railway centre & our primary objective as it was the junction of the railway from Tul Keram & Nablus with the line to Haifa & when we got it Haifa was cut off from railway communication.
There were millions of sandflies at Afuleh, a lot of buildings x a good deal of rolling stock & engines & a lot of ordnance stores. The plain of Esdraelon is exceedingly fertile & malarious rich black soil which is hard & cracked in summer & covered with the remnants of crops & in winter is a huge bog into which one sinks indefinitely. Next day I started off again to try & reach Semak xx at the South end of the sea of Tiberias where one of our Brigade had had a stiff scrap & a number of casualties. I went down to Busan first in the Jordan valley and attempted to go North to Semak but the road was impossible for cars & I gave up the attempt & returned tired as could be to Afuleh. Next morning at 0600 I started again this time by a different route following the main road through Nazareth among the hills to the town of Tiberias & then round the Southern shores of the lake to Semak. Nazareth is a pretty place rather like Bethlehem situated among huge hills & clustering on their slopes. It has some fine buildings mainly used as hospitals of late, & generally built of greyish stone. It is said that it was the main Turkish hospital base & certainly is high & healthy but very difficult of approach on account of the steep hills. The road ascends steeply even after Nazareth then drops again & runs along a valley - very pretty covered with crops & trees, then ascends again & runs along a plateau & suddenly the sea of Tiberias bursts upon one thousands of feet below. The view is one of the most magnificent I have seen - the still blue waters of the lake encircled by huge mountains, around & the white houses of the Town of Tiberias clustered on it's Southern shore. The descent is terribly steep into the town & then we turned to the right & skirted along the Southern shores till we reached the outlet of the Jordan from the lake. Semak where the wounded were lies about a mile beyond the Jordan & unfortunately the bridge was broken down & the ford rather deep for motors so I hailed a man on the opposite side to bring over his horse & I mounted behind him & thus forded the stream & rode on to the hospital. I asked them to load their wounded as quickly as possible into their xx horsed Ambulance wagons & take them across the ford thus & then transfer them to the motors. While they loaded the wagons I had some lunch with Single & Anderson (my quondam rival at the Varsity) & then went off with the wagons & made all speed to retrace my steps to Nazareth where a hospital had seen opened. What a tedious return trip especially as we met hundreds of wagons on the narrow road & it seemed a long 30 miles. However we reached Nazareth just after dark with all the badly wounded & got them into good comfortable beds in the French hospital. It must have been a good 70 mile trip altogether that day from Afuleh to Semak & back to Nazareth & I was a very tired man. However a good nights rest did wonders & next day I made for Tiberias again. On reaching that place I received orders to collect all the lightly sick & wounded from Semak who remained to Tiberias & evacuate by motor lorry. There were still some 60 people sick & wounded but more serious, so with my motors & Col Singles horse wagons & camels we got them all across safely. I had a Turkish hospital cleaned out for them & had brought along with me ten men from Nazareth as the advance party of our Ambulance which was moving up from there & with the aid of these ten we made some tea (we had no utensils with us but we improvised) dressed any that required it - with dressings from the Turkish pharmacy & made them as comfy as possible under the circumstances. Next day I moved on leaving Capt Humphries to complete the evacuation to Nazareth by aid of motor supply lorries which were expected to pass at any moment. That day I reached the crossing of the Jordan. on the North side of the sea of Tiberias The Turks had damaged the bridge but our engineers repaired it. The hill on the other side was terrific - I got tangled up with a lot of transport so pulled off the road & camped for the night. I will conclude this letter here my dear & continue the account in my next. But before I finish let me tell you of the transport (Turkish) we had passed on the road. At & about Jenin & between there & Afulah the road was absolutely blocked with transport - motor lorries in scores, wagons, touring cars, motor Ambulances -such a sight I have never seen. It was all trying to escape when our aeroplanes descended on it & absolutely frightened the drivers from their seats, they created such enormous havoc. And of course the cavalry coming in at the rear cut off their retreat also. But everywhere along the roads even as far as Nazareth & Tiberias were wagons & motor lorries scattered in an apparently endless succession. Interruption here my dear. I will continue my account from this onwards later as this letter is becoming too bulky & tedious for you to read. Lots of love to all & an extra share for mother from Her loving son Wilf  
Nothing further yet about that boat to take me home, one always has to wait a bit & the stunt has rather upset things for the time (I mean operations), but I can expect it at any time now I think so you may receive a cable to say I'm coming at any old time.
The letter was too bulky so the first half had to be put in another envelope my dear. Hope they both arrive safely Wilf
