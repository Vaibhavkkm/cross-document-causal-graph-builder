14th April, 1917  My Dear Birdie  Thank you very much for the  account of the attack. I think  the Brigades did splendidly & the  men were magnificent I am very  grieved about their losses & I hope  they are not too depressed & upset.  When he goes goes into the whole  story, it seems fairly clear that   Holmes would have saved a great  many lives & gained at the same  time an enormous success, if he 
had promptly & resolutely pushed  on his Reserves. He had 5½  Battalions I think unemployed_  if 4 of these (a Brigade) had  gone xx on within 30 minutes  of the attack starting straight  on to Riencourt & even Hendecourt  I think he would be there now!  It is an old lesson, but it  requires a soldier & it is not  possible to turn civilians into  
trained commanders in a few  months,- the wonder is that they  have picked up so much & done  as well as they have!  I saw Sir D. H. today; he  sent you & the 4th Divn many  messages of sympathy over their  disappointment . He does not  want us to go in till, the III  Army has got cherizy.  As things now are going there  won’t be any much chance of our
attacking before Tuesday -  However that will make more  of a certainty of the wire.  Yours ever,  HP Lynch.
