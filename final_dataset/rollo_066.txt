The grit they showed then & on the desert marches; it did us good to see each platoon in step, the beat their singing & marching chant - well it was great. Each platoon has a songster & singing made these marches much easier.  The night we took the road to the Canal, & out of the dismal desert well - the boys were in tremendous high spirits simply yelled their songs, made the pace too - so that we got into the station about an hour earlier than expected - after about 4 miles of marching. I've had to leave Harmony in Egypt - I am sorry to say.  He got dysentery on top of the desert march & was sent straight to Hospital.  He was very ill, so bad that he was taken away without the usual red tape formula of ordinary sick casualties - However - on the day we left we got news that he was about again, but not well enough to come with us.  He should join us in 2 - or 3 weeks' time - and I am keeping his place open in the Company. Our sea trip so far is most delightful - rather crowded but could be far worse, & of course the usual precautions against submarines are adopted, life-belts (or "halos" as our boys quickly dubbed them) being generally worn, though it is extremely uncomfortable.  The ship is fine, nice bright.  The weather is very pleasant.
