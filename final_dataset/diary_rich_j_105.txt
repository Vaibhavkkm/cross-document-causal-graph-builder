March 11th. Sunday. Parade was half an hour later this morning. With the officers in Sam Browns and the men "drill order" we marched onto one of the numerous parade grounds nearby, and with Colonel Stephens in charge, ceremonial work was carried out. It was very instructive indeed. From 1030 the day was free, so I went with Sampson and Bennett into Amiens by the 11 20 returning by the 18 20 from Amiens with a number of parcels.
