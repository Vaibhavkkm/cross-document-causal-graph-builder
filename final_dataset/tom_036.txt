Gay Millie Leo Goods & Chattels Eileen & Bankbook 
Cortoon 10th February, 1915

My dear Tom. We are anxiously looking for next mail. Mrs. Burns received a cable from Gay yesterday, saying she was in Egypt. I wonder will you see her. Eileen no doubt has written news of us all but somehow I like you to know how much I think about you dear. Eileen bears your absence  bravely but I know her true heart is sad with longing she courageously looks in the future & finds pleasure on working cloths d'oylies &c. Little Molly is a Sunbeam & gives Eileen much happiness she has grown so fond of Eileen & just loves to go to her glory box, the dear kiddie remembers you well we asked her who she went to the zoo with she replied Uncle Tom & he carried me when I was asleep. Alfie has made a fool of things I have not heard the facts but he had to resign  from the military & also lost posture  in Government. Oh Tom how.
