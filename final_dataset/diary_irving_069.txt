At Camp - At Home
Up at 5:30. Dress and police bunk. Reveille. Wash and shave. Breakfast. Steak, because I am late, oatmeal, coffee. Police platoon room, and around bunk and prepare for inspection of quarters. Take another turn at my gun. Inspection promptly at 7:15. Everything OK. Then outside for company inspection. Pleased that Capt. is away, for Lt. Cook has charge and will not, therefore, have opportunity to inspect my gun. Lt. Stevens passes it as perfect. Company reformed double line. Lt. Cook makes announcement about pass situation and warns men not to overstay leave. Dismissed for day. Go to Hostess House with Mendelsohn. Quite cold without overcoat. Write for an hour. Pay a long promised visit to Camp Library. A surprise in store for me. A fine place. Writing and reading tables. An open fire-place. Very light. Well stocked with books and magazines. Take a book of war stories. See many books, including histories on present war. Back to quarters, read and take a nap. Awake in time for dinner. Corned beef, cabbage and potatoes, coffee, with an extra glass of milk. Telephone Leah that I will be home on 4 PM train. Pass list up first thing in morning. Go to RR stations to buy two tickets. Back to quarters. Look for mail. Name called out. Visitor to see me. A friend of Morris Berger introduces himself. Name called again. Lieut. McDougall wants me. I almost run into him. He has a pass for 2:30 train, if I am ready to go. I am. Take abrupt leave of Rosenberg and get upstairs for book and gloves, Leah gave me, which I want to wear to please her. Inspection at Regt. Hdqrs. Start for train. Get good seat. Read newspaper and book. Make a very quick trip to Jamaica. Penn Station at 5:00. Home 5:30. A pleasant surprise to Leah and Mama. Mama cries. Leah is happy. A good supper. Call up theatre. Try to get tickets. No success. Stay till 7:45. Go to theatre of streets to make another attempt. Want to see “The Copperhead” or “Jack O’Lantern” with Fred Stone, my favorite comedian. Speculator offers tickets for “Jack O’Lantern.” I refuse to pay premium. He follows me. Sells at stamped price. Show has started. Good seats. Never before have I been so pleased with a play. Leah and I live over the time when I first took her to see Fred Stone. During intermission try to call up Leah’s Mama. Do not get connection. Theatre full of men in uniform. Broadway crowded with soldiers and sailors too. Play over, have soda. Go home 12 o’clock boat. See Corral after deserters in subway, and meet Yvette. Home at one. Tea things set for us. Have tea and go to bed, very tired, but supremely happy. Play, which is first we have seen this year, has desired effect. Drives away gloom. I must be up at seven in morning to keep appointment with men in City, who propose to buy my plant. Will not get much sleep, but if I can sell business and relieve Leah of responsibilities, it is worth sacrifice of comfort and time. Both sleep well.
