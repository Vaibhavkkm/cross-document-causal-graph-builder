Dear Dad, I have been going to write to you lately, but so far have had no oportunity until now, & even now have not much time. We have just come out of the line for 2 or 3 days, & expect to go back again very soon. The bad weather may possibly hold up the advance a little, which is a pity, for we were going ahead steadily and surely, & it was looking as if Fritz  must withdraw a good deal & find another line of resistance. It is very hard going, & seems to be getting worse  every day - new inventions,  & harder fighting. Shall be glad when the Yanks come in & ease the pressure a little. The R.S.M had H.Q. out on squad drill this afternoon
I get very little drill at any time, & therefore am very stale. We got over it however! That yarn about the 5,000 Australians getting leave to visit Aus:  has recently been contradicted, -  I never did take much notice  of the rumour.  - it has been floating about for a long time now - It would be a very difficult almost impossible thing to do just now. Don't attempt to do more work than you are phisically able to do - we can manage somehow without:  So if you  find work is too much for you leave it alone. I am enclosing a photo of the memorial we (the Pioneers)  erected at Posieres in memory of our lads who fell there. The name plate is screwed on to the wooden cross, & the photo is an enlargement of the plate.
I stamped those names on myself with single letter dies - it took me quite a long time as you will see.  The plate is of aluminium, & part of a 'plane. Hope you are all well, & having as good a time as possible. I am still in good health so far. With Love to Chickie & Mother & yourself Your affectionate Son, Will.
