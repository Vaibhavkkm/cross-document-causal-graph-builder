 BY APPOINTMENT TO THE LATE KING EDWARD. J. & W. McKILLOP.   
                                         My dear Mum. By the above  address you will see that  I am in the great Scotch  town Glasgow It is simply  a beastly day one of  those heavy thick fogs  which are so depressing Father will know all about  them. Arrived here yesterday 
morning a lovely clear day it was to had a good  look around the city it  is much livier a place  than Edinburgh and rather  a good young town I  think except for these  beastly fogs which are  simply rotten Am up  here with a Scotch  officer staying with him and his people they are kindness itself 
and as he knows the men of the town plenty of people etc we are having a fine time have lunch and dinner out each day meet plenty of Scotchmen who will make me have a or several whiskies with them of course the grog is OK it will always do me. Am going on to Edinburgh in a couple of days time on our way back to London to have another look around there Having a great time and feeling OK except for a bad cold which is impossible to shake off in this country  Have just had lunch here off out for afternoon tea to meet some Glasgow lasses bridge party tonight after dinner so you see going strong.  Will write again soon.  lots of love to all, Boby
