 Just a very brief note as mail leaves camp-  we are still all awaiting Jacko if his travelling to  us - he’s got fine weather for it - but you’ll  will know what’s doing before this reaches you.  Plenty of work - digging - outposts nightly -  but everyone’s very fit - & very eager to hear  the order “3 rounds Rapid ”  etc  No news otherwise - desert in this part is a   bit changed - marvellous what  “MacLagan’s Circus”  does when it when it stays in such places as Habeita.  Will write a pukka letter later on Sunday- so close  with much love- and hope you’re all as well as I am.  Your loving Rollo
