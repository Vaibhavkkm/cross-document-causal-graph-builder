 Date: 24.5.1918,  My Dear Family, Late last evening received a note from Col Marks telling me of the awful news which ere this you all know only too much about. Have just returned from the 13th Battalion & they are all very much cut up about it. They lost two of their best officers with poor old Longun & Doc Wallach. At present I am unable to realise it. He died 13th May at 5 minutes past seven in the morning  & was buried at Etaples Military Hospital Grave No A414 on the 14th May 1918 Although one expects these things to happen daily it is at the  same time a tremendous shock. But do not be sad about it remember that Longun died a very noble Death & if you could only hear the opinion of both men & officers of the 13th Battalion you all would be the proudest family in the world. Mum you must bear up & push sadness aside & be proud that God was good enough to give you a son who would be brave & true enough to fight & die for his Home Country & King. Remember that no man could die better, that he passed away peacefully & happily & was given a decent burial & if it is at all possible I will do my best to go to Etaples & try & arrange to keep the grave in order.
It is a strange thing that I never knew about his death until late last evening I suppose it was because we were in the line. His personal belongings I understand have all been sent home. I have just written to Millie Henley telling her the facts & asking them  either to cable to Jack Tivey or home. The facts are this A small attack was to be made combined with another Battalion  Longun's Company gained their objective the other Battalion people withdrew. Longun then went up to see his Coy & tell them to hang on & to try & bring the other people up again when he was knocked He received a compound fracture of the left thigh & must have died a most as soon as he got to the hospital at Etaples. I have just received letters from home Dagmar & Rosalie & Little Tammy dated end of March They have cheered me up immensely but I am thinking of you all at home You say you receive very few letters from me Well I write every week or as near to that as possible so a tremendous number must have gone down So very glad that you Went out & saw Bert Maiden he is a grand chap. Am very surprised to hear of his engagement. Glad to hear that the show & all the comforts fund entertainments were so successful Mick old Boy cheer up & try your hardest to cheer Mum Dad & the girls up Be brave son & look after them all at home for me. Now is your chance to show a smiling face & be merry & bright. Let us hope & pray that I may be spared to get back again to you all at home with the very best of love to you all, Len
