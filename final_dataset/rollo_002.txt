We are all in tip-top condition - and this week the  men are to be put through a course 'on the ranges'. I expect great things from my boys, so we are all anxiously looking forward to "Some" shooting. Rapid aiming & loading is my 'Fad' at present - my chaps must curse me at times for I make their thumbs & wrists ache - but the time is coming when they will appreciate the  arduous & monotonous work here.  In my spare time I'm going to learn more about machine gunnery - but I am watching a certain chance for promotion - but as M.G. wont do me as far as prom. is concerned I wont trouble much about it. Re India - I recd. a reply that at present I am too old for a Commission, but after the war there may be opportunities. Mind I don't intend to go on my knees to get in the Br. or Indian armies - I'd rather go  to Hell than serve under or with some of the English puppy mongrels who have got coms. since war began - some of the new type are a disgrace to the British annals. If some of the fellows I have seen are fair specimens of the  English - well thank God - I'm an Australian.  The British Army contains many good ones - but there are others who lack initiative, endurance & resource, & God help England if she relies on these last. I guess the bones of the old '/82. heroes felt like coming to attention as we marched past. This is a weird letter - but this war has made me intensely British & absolutely Australian. Much love etc.
