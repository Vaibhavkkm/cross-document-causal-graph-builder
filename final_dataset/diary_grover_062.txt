May 15, 1918 – Went to “C” battery about 10 a.m. Place was immediately shelled, two hit about 8 or 10 yds. from me. Was hit all over by clods of earth. Was expecting to be wounded any min. Got in a shell hole for 30 min. Went to “B” battery & it was shelled also. Was chased all over the place. Kept falling on the ground when heard shells coming & running between times. Real hot day, too. Went out of action at 4 p.m. Went in camp about 2½ miles west of Watou.1
