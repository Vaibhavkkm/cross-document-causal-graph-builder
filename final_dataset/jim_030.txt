France, 28/5/1916.
Dear Perce,
I have not had a letter from
you yet but I know they are delayed
somewhere. I met Mr Heathcote, and
he had a letter from you dated 6/3/16.
He was very glad you remembered him.
I suppose you know Mr Langford by this.
How did you get on in that
swimming championship? I hope you
had good luck. I am playing football
here today, and am to captain my
company against the Artillery. I am not
sure that will we will not "get the cane"
but we will at least "keep them busy".
I suppose you are a much improved
player this year, but mind don't forget
to score well at the exams. as well as 
in matches! Love from
Brother Jim.
