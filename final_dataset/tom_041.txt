FOR CORRESPONDENCE
A letter to Mother, [[Fae & also]]  to Lindsy  as well as a short note to you from which  you may be able to gather that all is well This Censorship [[is]] maddening. Everything I want to say I can't put in & then what I could write I don't want to on a postcard or letter that will be read by  censor officials. It will be a glorious day when the next  mail comes along although it is only a fortnight since the last. Still we are waiting for it anxiously. How many days did you have in Feb, over a hundred? When we once get clear of the censor there are thousands of things I will have to tell you. The troops are all in very good health. I think I will have to extend that [[biscuit?]] of May until June though there is still a chance.  They don't seem in any great hurry to finish it off.  Perhaps things will move quicker at the beginning of. I am in splendid health. Not  wrong with me.  Tom
