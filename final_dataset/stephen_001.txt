Dear Mother   Just a few lines to let you know that I am quite well and I  hope you are also quite well. I received your welcome letter today and was  glad to hear from you and to know that you were quite well also Mine  Flo Will Mother at last we have got to the "front" and are not far away from  the German frontline most of the lads are in the firing line but the Platoon I  am in are out in reserve behind the first line our job is guard and fatigue  work so up to the present time have not had a shot at the beggars but we  get plenty of bullets and shells over us you ought to see us duck when  we hear them coming we are doing some ducking at the present as  fritz is sending a few shrapnel and high explosives shell in but  we are getting quite used to them now we are going out for a spell in a  few days time we have been here now ten days and are doing fine  up till now a couple of the lads have been killed and wounded one of the  men of the 10 rifls as been killed A WILD his photo is in the group which you  have Bob is not yet Back with the Battalion but I had a letter from  him to say that he is well and that he is somewhere in france Dear  Mother a couple of days ago I was with a fatigue party we were digging  a sap just behind the firing line there were six of us and a couple of  engineers we had been working from 6-15 in the morning and at about  11-30 it began to rain and 12 oclock was knock off time well when it  began to rain we where beginning to think it was time to buzz off 
so we started to git our things together when old fritz put a Bomb over  it struck the ground about fifteen yards away from us it did not go off  for a about a few seconds after landing but when it did go off it through  the mud about abroads you should of seen us brave soldiers do a get as  when one comes over you can bet your sweet life that it is not an orphan  but has a lot of mates to follow so we got back to our little dugouts  and spent a quite afternoon there and had a good sleep we do not get  to much sleep of a night time if our lads are not putting a few shells  into fritz will he puts a few into us and then our lads get a move  on and between the pair of them they make a deuce of a row  while they are at it the poor unfortunate infantry have to do a bit  of ducking or lay full length at the bottom of the trench. We are having  nice weather over here at present a mixture of rain and sunshine  much better than Egypt I have seen Jim Bryce since I came to  France but have not seen C Harnett or any of the Manly boys  Dear Mother the letter I received from you was dated 13th May  I have a letter from you and also one from Bert for Bob as soon  as I see him again. With best love  I remain  Your Loving Son  Stephen
