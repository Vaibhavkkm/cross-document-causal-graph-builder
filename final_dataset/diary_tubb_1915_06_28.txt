I slept at the Hotel Roma just behind the Majestic- reported to Col Johnston at 9.30 & found that no boat was going to day. Received orders to report again at 9.30 tomorrow. I saw Lt Connolley at Mustapha & found out that Lt Heighway was going home to Australia on the "Ballarat" to day. Heard that Col Bolton's C.O. of the 8th Bn was joining the boat at Suez and going home also. Drew £4 from Paymaster & got my teeth seen too. Met Lt Bolton at the Base record office (at the Metropole) & went with  
him and Lt Weeks down to the wharf- quay 73 where we found the Ballarat. I went aboard and met Heighway we had a great yarn. he told me that he would go & see my folk at St Helena after he got home, I gave him my diary (original) to take home for me, & a box of cigarettes for Father. I was very pleased to see Heighway & to have the chance of sending messages by him. Capt Bannister was going home also, & I saw a few of the 7th boys also. There are 600 Australians going - I believe Major [[Blizard?]] & others are going by a later boat(?) I was interested in reading the B.O. from the front. I see that Capt Weddell who has been officiating as C.O. 7th Bn for some time is now a Major. Capt McCrae is also a Major Lt Grills is a Captain & there are a number of recently appointed  second lieutenants also. Our casualty list to date (Field returns are not complete yet)
numbers 868 and 30 officers respirators are being issued & instructions how to use them Things are pretty willing over there at present, & but a very hot time is expected before long I don't think I'll get a boat for a day or two yet? The Embarkation Officer tells me a boat is leaving this week but he cannot say what day. Frank came in to see me at 7.30 pm We had a good talk & he left for home & I left to write, Frank will come in on Wednesday again. Lt Capt Layk & Lt Liddlelow have gone back to Gallipoli to join the Bn.  10.30pm I am sitting in my room at the Hotel Rome, & watching the passers by & street traffic. A continuous roar & rattle is going on. Street cries of all keys & sorts.
