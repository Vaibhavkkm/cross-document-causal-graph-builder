In The Trenches Somewhere in France April 20th 1916  Dear Mum, Well I hope y this finds you well as it leaves me in the best of health & having a jolly good time. It is fairly quiet here & we get plenty to eat & plenty of work. That usualy consist of our good time up to dates. but at anyrate that is what we came for. By all accounts we will be shifting to some trenches where they are bombarding all day long & most of the night too as we can hear them quite plain from where we are. I hope they start this offensive move that they talk so much about. I hope Ev comes & sees you regular now that Blanche has gone. Ill tell you what you ought to do mum & that is look after one of Ev's young girls. That would  be just what you want to keep you company. Well I have not got much y news today & also not much  time so I must close with love to all from Your loving Son  X X X X Wally
