Notes.
1 This is the same name that appears in the Aug. 25 entry. I cannot be sure of the spelling in either entry.
This is a “best guess”.

2 Actually the above referenced article states: The Collège was three times a hospital before the World War:
First, during the war with England in 1790, then in 1814, when Napoleon, near the end of his career, was
fighting on the Marne, and in 1870 when Juilly was occupied by the Prussians.
