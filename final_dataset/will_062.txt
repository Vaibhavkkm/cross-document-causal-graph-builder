30 Bruton St  W  3.2.1917     Dear General ,  Thank you for your two letters of 27th &  30th Jany, & still more for the kind things you cabled  to the minister about me.  I am sorry you do not agree with my action  in cabling myself, or rather with what I cabled, but  I felt (& feel still) that it ought to be done. At  any rate, there it is, & I must stand by it.  I recognise thoroughly that you had to give the  minister your views about Morris work at Salisbury,  whether it affected my chances or not: as indeed  it must, once you had decided not to appoint a  GOC in England for A.I.F. there.  I think Legge's strong objection to being recalled  to Australia is that he considers the recall to be  the result of a mistaken view about his health, &   that he is to suffer for the mistake. I do not  know whether he shares my feeling that G.H.Q.  treated us both rather cavalierly, & my curiosity as  to whether regulars are treated in the same way.  As the action was taken, I think myself that  Smyth was more than entitled to a Division, & to  me he is as completely A.I.F. now as if he had  sailed with us from Australia: his appointment cannot 
justly be resented by anyone.  I am sorry to learn that your chest is again  troubling you. You must not get ill, for 1st Anzac  without you is hardly thinkable.  Little as you relish the idea of giving evidence  before the Commission, you are not likely to escape  the ordeal;  & your coming over will give me the  chance of seeing you again soon.  Will you please remember me to White.  With all fond wishes to yourself,  I am  Yours most sincerely,  J.W.McCay
