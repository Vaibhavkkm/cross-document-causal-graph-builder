 GRAND HOTEL  HELOUAN.  HOTEL DES BAINS. SULPHUR BATH ESTABLISHMENT.
CAIRO, Egypt, November 1st,  1916   My dear mother, Just a few lines  to tell you that I am here on three  days leave & am enjoying myself  & spending much money in buying  a new rig out as I was in need of many things.  There are a  few officers from my Brigade  in town at present & that helps  to make things enjoyable. I was awfully upset to read in your last letter that Norton  Bloomfield had been killed in  France & also one of the Ryan  boys.  Their parents must feel  it dreadfully - please convey  my sympathy.  More & more do  I conclude that war is a  senseless horrible thing. Am afraid that I am spending  so much money on kit this  time that I won't be able to  send anything for Xmas, especially  as I had promised the Job  I would send them something  ever since I have been in  Egypt & have never done so, & if I can manage it I must  try & fulfill the promise &  then I shall feel more comfortable.
