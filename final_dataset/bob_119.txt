My dear Mum, Received letters from home the other day one from Mick dated 2nd Oct 2 from Lorna one not dated the other 14/10/17 one from you Mum 3rd. Oct one from Jane 14th Oct. It is a rotten day cold raining muddy an equally rotten camp leaky huts some overcrowded and generally most uncomfortable. We are again in the forward area and expect shortly there will be lots doing again we have had no luck being moved up here from our most comfortable quarters. in the last area. Went for a ride yesterday afternoon to see Nana found his Battn but learned
he had just gone across to London for 14 days leave he is too lucky and no doubt he will have a ripping time. Saw some of the officers of the Battn Col Perry Major Allen had several. wads with them then rode on to an officers Club at - where we had afternoon tea & several more wads.  Just had a letter from Hope Davies in which she tells me her Father has passed away of course they are all upset but it is a happy release for all concerned apparently. Jacques is an expression we use a lot here we talk about the troops being Jacques etc it means OK everything in the garden is lovely.  Absolutely no news in this hole nothing but cold rain mud & generally uncomfortable  lots of love to all, Bob.
