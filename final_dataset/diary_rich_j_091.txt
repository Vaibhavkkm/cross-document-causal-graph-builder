Friday   25th. Up at 5.a.m. and away to the  boat with the transport horses at 8 o/clock. One man one  horse and they behaved splendidly going through the City to Dalgety's wharf The going aboard was accomplished  in ½  hours. They were first lead led up a long gangway with high sides and coconut matting spread over the big cleats to prevent slipping Our horse were first under the main  deck while there were layers of horses on two decks below, making in all 4 decks of horses, the lower one being perhaps 40 ft. down the hold, they  were not lowed down but walked  down along the gangways. It was just wonderful. I skipped the ranks and had tea with Mrs Sponza. and came  back by 7.30.
