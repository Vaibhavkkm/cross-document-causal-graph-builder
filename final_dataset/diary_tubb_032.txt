 Moved into inner harbour early this morning. I notice a big difference in appearance the island has got browner & tents & camps are much more plentiful There are a number of war ships around us. Heard this morning that 1000 yds of trenches has been captured? Had a talk with Sgt Birrell D.C.M. he says that the British fired at them, in the dusk at Cape Helles on the night of the Attack by the 2nd Bde, mistaking them for Turks, he is sure of this happening as one of the 7th men (Cartwright) heard the English officer give the command Many of our men were hit the bullets coming from the left rear!? Birrell would not or could not say why he was recommended he does not know where it was or who recommended him he thinks it must have been at Gaba Tepe
 
11.30 still anchored no order yet re our going off. Time is drawing near for us to disembark. Thinking it wise not to take this [[with?]] me I am getting the Padre to post it for me Good luck to all at St. Helena Love from Frederick.
