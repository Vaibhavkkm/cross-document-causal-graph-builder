Mena Camp.  24/2/1915  We are all very annoyed at the rumours that have been   circulated in Australia about the behaviour of our troops   here. - Undoubtedly there have been excesses  (in some cases serious) - but - I have been informed  on many sides by local inhabitants & the local   press confirms that the general behaviour is really   excellent; moreover any misdemeanours are   properly handled by the town picquets. -        We had one of our reinforcements play up - the other   day  - This chap threatened an officer with a bayonet    it took the whole guard to arrest him (about 12 men)   & then he started shouting & resisting. So he was pegged   down to the ground and gagged. He loosened the first   lot of pegs and nearly got away. They put stronger pegs   down this time. He is now spending a few days in   a detention barrack where they get plenty of work & very 
little food and sleep. So things are not being “let go”  as the article in ‘Sunday Times’ would seem to   insinuate. - I took the nurses to the Zoo  & we saw there the two Turkish Pontoons with which  the Turks attempted to cross the Canal. They were  made of aluminium & were riddled with holes,  mostly from shrapnel.
