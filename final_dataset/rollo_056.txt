Text:   I’m no longer O.C. of A. as several senior  officers have returned to the strength. - so we’ll  have to wait resignedly for our chances.  I’m back with C. - but if I can I will get  back to A - as most of my ‘originals’ are up  there & I enjoyed my stay there. Anyhow I was  doing O.C. work for a month & not 21 yet. Our mails are held up in Egypt and our  ‘relief’ postponed indefinitely so you may be  able to guess 'what’s what’. I hear Stan, caught “double pneumonia” when  holidaying in Egypt - & is now invalided to  Aussie - along with Stopp, Gordon, & Heming.  I’m the only officer left in C. of those who were  here when I arrived - Shaw is at Battn. H.Q, &  Cornish invalided to England - while poor Cullen  was sniped, & succumbed to his wounds.  Lorenzo is due from Italy & Cairo - & then Shaw  will come back to us - probably to A. & then I’ll  apply for a transfer so as to be with him.  At present I’m virtually O.C. of C - & my old  N.C.O.s are at work in others' platoons since my  absence - & a lot of dead heads come in their place  This shifting about plays the deuce with platoons  & it makes all the more work for me now.
