W. Evans 9th LH Regiment. 12. 4. 1916
My dear mother, Since I last wrote you a mail has come to hand with a letter from you & Mrs Bloomfield & Dr Rennie. I am very glad that you received the things safely & liked them - when I go to Cairo next time I shall send along some more. I had originally intended the small vases for you but you do as you please. I had also a another shawl of the same kind as I sent you but found it had a flaw in it & was not able to procure another like it in Cairo. You ask where the troops from Anzac are - well my dear, that is just what I can't tell you. I am a little short of writing paper at present & am using old stuff as we had a terrific windstorm the other night & my tent blew down as the pegs don't hold well in this sand & when I came to gather my things together 
I couldn't find the pad & also a letter I had just written. You would have laughed to see me with my batman & groom gathering up my belongings in the moonlight in the midst of a howling wind & flitting away with them to my new humpy which fortunately was just completed. Half the tents in the camp came down & it was a funny spectacle & then when some of the boys put them up again they blew down in the middle of the night. I had a further experience since then, as yesterday I rode down to a post some four miles away & on the return journey the wind which had in the morning been rather brisk freshened to a gale & we were unable to see a hundred yards in front of us. It was frightfully unpleasant riding through this r sandstorm or khamseen as it is called as the loose sand rises in clouds & flings itself on the unfortunate rider. Fortunately I was wearing goggles & they protected my eyes. We came along well for a while passed one of our posts & turned over a sandridge we knew well & made for our camp. However it was not so simple as it 
seemed because the country here is practically all alike & the sun was almost obliterated th we could distinguish no landmarks. Also this is a new camp to me & hard to find, so after a while we thought we were there & found we weren't, so we turned & went to the top of a sandridge but could see nothing. I was accompanied by one of the medical orderlies & decided that the wisest thing to do was to stay where we were until the storm cleared a little. So down we sat & held our horses & spent a most unpleasant hour. The sand poured over us like a shower bath continuously & our poor horses stood like two statues the very picture of misery. However we told some tales & cracked a few jokes & after a while we saw two men walking & a man riding & waved but they did not see us. We soon saw however that they also were lost & we had great sport 
watching their movements & today I was talking to an officer in the next regiment named Bucklan who went to school at Cooerwull Academy & on comparing notes found it was as he. We knew we were not far from camp as we had only ridden about 20 minutes from the last spot we had recognised. After we had waited for about an hour during which the sand continued to be driven by the wind with great intensity, it moderated slightly & I caught sight of some abandoned humpies about half a mile away which I thought I recognised  & we rode over to them & found we were right & then set off again & this time found our way safely to camp. A good number of others had difficulty also & some of them spent the night out & came in today as the wind has now subsided a good deal. In future when the wind is strong I intend staying at home.
I wrote last to you when in Cairo & forget just what I told you. Did I tell you that I paid a visit to Harold Thomas of Manly who is in a British General Hospital in Cairo? He went home & joined there There was an opening of a tennis court at the Hospital that day & I tried to play tennis but was a lamentable failure as I was so completely out of practice. Thomas looks well & was very glad to see me. I  think I told you that our Church of England padrē was staying at the same hotel & we went to the "Kinsaal" together. It is a kind of variety show something like the Tivoli in Sydney & is practically the only place of the kind in Cairo. We enjoyed the first part but grew sleepy later as it did not commence till 9.30p.m. & we left before the end. I came back by train & arrived at my stop at 10.30p.m. where a man was waiting with the horses & 
I spent the night with one of our  officers who is camped near there, slept beautifully on the floor came on here next day. My humpy is a regular da/isy Two large windows covered with hessian to keep out flies & sand & good door on manufactured hinges, the whole lined with the straw mats so common in this country. But a visitor has just dropped in so must conclude with best of love from Your loving son, Wilf.
