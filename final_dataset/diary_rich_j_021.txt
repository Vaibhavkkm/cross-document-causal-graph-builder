Friday Oct 23rd The menu shows up a little better and stronger just now. Yesterday we had porridge & stewed sausages with ^tea & bread & jam to finish off with.  At dinner 12 o'clock there was soup, meat with beans & potatoes. followed by plum pudding. At tea we had tea with bread butter & jam. The mess orderlies are settling down now and though our rations are a little under weight I feel sure all will come round pleasantly as the journey continues. The sea is now as calm as is possible and in consequence none of the fellows are sick though if it should blow up a little these crowded decks would be hell with a vengenc second roll call. as the fellows have to take down their hammocks at 6 o'clock tidy up their odds & ends and are not allowded inside again hardly until 6 pm when the hammocks are laid out.  with lights out at 9 pm. The bag-pipers and the military brass band with perhaps a short evening Church service add considerable to break the dulness of the day and give the troop a little harmony which is absolutely essential to their brute like nature. Gambling goes on all over the boat, ^no not attempts are made to prevent it. I waited for 1 hour in a line to get to the dry canteen and when I got there I could not buy any ink fruit or cake so I bought 2 packets of cigarettes & matches and two bottles of lemonade.
