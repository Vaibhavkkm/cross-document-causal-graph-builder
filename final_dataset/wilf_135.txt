CERTUM PETE FINEM THE BLUE FUNNEL LINE S.S. "AENEAS." 27.1.1919 My dear mother, Just a hurried scrawl to say that we are just going in to Albany & should arrive in Sydney in about a weeks time - watch the papers All well & have had a good trip - don't get too excited now. I am not going to try & tell you about the voyage as I expect to be with you about a day or so after this letter reaches you so will close with much love from Your loving son Wilf.
