Am glad Miss Taylor has left you, it will be far better without her.   Hope Miss Cutler doesn't come home often, don't encourage her.  Am glad Charl has got work, it is a great relief.  The success of recruiting campaign has bucked all the troops up wonderful.  Tell Mab I've got the copper driving band off a Turks shell to make into a bangle for her.
 Love to Floss Robbie.  Tell Jack, that Jack Heywood is back again with us & is livelier than ever  Don Mc Conville is attached to Heavy Battery  Thank May Tilton for her great letters to me. Hope to see her soon.  Have not received any Newspapers by last 2 Mails yet   Love, to all at Winchelsea  Also to Aunt Hannah, & hope she is quite well  How is the Lawn looking,?  Tell Rupert that the old, Turks don't like Australian bayonets  Hope George is well & his business a success. I do not think it would be worth while to give it up to come out here. There are plenty of others available for this work  Received the letter which Ruby Davidson sent to you. Very decent of her, isn't it. Her people were magnificent towards me, & I'll never forget their kindnesses.  Little Les Ilsley, my mate Trumpeter in the New Zealanders (he went over from Victoria to do Insurance Work, you remember) is missing.  Often run across South Yarra chaps out here, some of whom I've not seen for years
