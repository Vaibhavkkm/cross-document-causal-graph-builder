Text:  If Roumania comes in at once we can give  Bulgaria a kidney punch & put the Kybosh  on that mongrel race.  I've heard from Mattner - that he, Carthew,  & Shepherd have decided to come. Coghill's class  made a name in the A.H.S. at Sports & Exams.  (especially Higher Public 1912) & now in 1915  most of us are doing our duty. I'm very  glad Cog's coming too. All good luck to him.  That damned pro German of our class still  stands out - & it's time he & Williams were  given the hint by the Educ. Dept. Instead  like snakes they are taking places that  should be ours when we get back. But our  turn will come some day, & then God help them.  Beaver & Jacob are new back with the  Battn. so I may have to hand over my job  but still I've been O.C. for nearly a month, & I  haven't made a howling mess of it anyhow.  I'm only a nipper yet - (Moule & McDonald  bucked against my temp. Capt). & may have  plenty of time for a pukka Captaincy & so  I'm not torn asunder with grief - & now know  'what's what' about M. & Mc. I'm taking a bit of  int in M. Guns lately - close by their "pozzy"  50 letters to censor in 10 minutes. 'Ta ta.'
