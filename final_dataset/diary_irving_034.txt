Weather: fair, mild Health: good
Up at 6:00. Reveille. Breakfast, corn meal mush, syrup, 2 apples, toast and butter, black coffee. No milk to be had at camp nor at PE or AM&C. Out for work at 7:00. Captain sends back most of company to listen to Lieut. Mullins lecture on insurance. Snowing. Drill close order. Picture of entire company taken. Worked until 12:00. “Like niggers” as boys say. New Corporal, an over-anxious, nervous kid, 4th platoon. Begins drilling manual, right, left and post at once. Lieut. Cook looks in and tells us we have a better trick in store for us. Two letters from Leah. See Captain about getting pass and hand in completed papers for exemption claim. Promised pass for first train on Saturday. Dinner, boiled beef, stewed corn, soup, crackers, cocoa. Out at 1:00. Drill in firebreak for a time then hike to Smith’s Field for a little competition in which we acquit ourselves favorably. Back at 2:30. A Court Martial in session in Mess Hall. Private accused of opening packages of registered mail. Go to Orderly Room about insurance. Discover that Capt. McMurtry is a near neighbor of Mama’s 22 East 70th Street. Peek into Mess Hall. Grim looking affair. Supper after Court Martial adjourns. Bully beef for the first time. Very good. Potatoes, string beans, bread pudding, cocoa. Write. To Orderly Room on errand for Lt. Mullins. To see Mark with goodies from Mama. Not in. To YMCA to telephone Leah. She is not home. Probably to see Mr. Wagner and Mama. Thirsty on way back and stop in P.E. Not a drink of soda to be had in either of them. No water at YMCA. Back to barracks. Write. Read newspaper. Very interesting development of economic situation which in my opinion will hasten peace. To bed at 11.
