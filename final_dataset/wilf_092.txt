24.6.1917. My dear mother, I have now returned to my abode in Palestine & left the gay city behind and it may surprise you to learn that I travelled back in a novel way, to wit, by aeroplane. I chanced to meet a pilot in the Flying Corps whom I knew, & he had brought a machine to Cairo & was returning with another on the very day that my leave was up, & having the vacant "observers" seat he offered to take me & of course I risked the opportunity as I had been anxious for some time past to have a fly & in addition it would save so much time & dreary train travelling. We left in the morning from the Cairo aerodrome about 11 a.m. The pilot took his seat behind & then I clambered cautiously into the observer's seat in front as it is very easy to damage the frail wings. The mechanics started the engines by turning round the propeller which is situated in front & as soon as it was in motion it was impossible to hear anything else as it makes an awful row.
We were muffled up in flying caps which extend over the ears & head & wore overcoats as it is very cool when one is up some thousands of feet, although scorching hot on the ground. The mechanics after the engines started removed the blocks which are placed under the wheels of the aeroplane. which when resting on the ground to prevent them moving, & the pilot set her in motion & she glided over the ground on her wheels gradually gaining speed until she seemed to be rushing along at breakneck pace & then he lifted her off the earth & up we rose into the air. We gradually rose until we were some hundreds of feet up & I wondered for a moment if I should feel seasick but the feeling passed away & I felt quite comfortable. We watched the houses growing smaller as we climbed & the people who became like so many pigmies & then we turned away & left them all behind. We still rose & eventually reached 7000 feet above the earth when it became quite cold. When travelling along at that height in a straight direction, one feels quite stationary in the air although the speed is great as the earth does not appear to be moving & it is impossible to fix on any object to judge of one's speed. The sensation when turning however is quite weird, somewhat like a ships motion & the earth is seen at all angles as the machine slopes at angles which to the beginner are terrifying. I could pick up the railway line, canals, houses trees, trains, cultivation etc as we passed on to the canal & was thoroughly enjoying myself & eventually the canal itself & the bitter lakes hove in sight. Ismalia looked awfully pretty as there the canal broadens out into lakes & we could see boats resting snugly on the water, & the houses nestling among the trees, the whole making a very pretty sight. We had a note to drop for Colonel Arnott at Moasca (where Jack will be going) so we gradually descended there making all kinds of turns & circles until we were quite low down & there we saw a large parade in progress & dropped our note right into it almost at Colonel Arnott's feet - it was to tell him that his son in France had gained the cross de guerre. I wondered if by chance Jack had arrived & was in that very parade but I had heard no word. After this we rose rapidly again & pushed on but shortly descended to earth to partake of lunch with some friends of my pilot. We had a rest for an hour or two & then rose from earth again & flew away across the desert towards this part. We could see the railway & trains going & coming, & see the various spots where we have camped during the campaign as we have pushed the enemy gradually back over the Sinai & it was very interesting to travel so rapidly & easily over the very  parts where we had toiled so laboriously  over soft sand dunes in the blazing sun. I was by this time quite accustomed to the motion & taking an active interest in everything as we passed. I could pick out the very tent in the camp where I stayed a few days ago with Max Yuille. When almost to our journeys end we sighted three enemy aeroplanes high up in the air & our own anti aircraft guns blazing away at them & as we were between the guns & the enemy the shells passed us & caused currents of air which shook the machine. Of course we didn't go looking for the Germans but made for our aerodrome where we safely alighted & I settled down to wait for my horses to turn up, & eventually stayed the night & came out next morning. It was one of the most glorious trips I have ever had & the 250 miles from Cairo took only a little over three hours to travel, whereas by train it would have taken about 24 hours & wretchedly uncomfortable ones at that. In the machine it is impossible for the observer to speak with the pilot save by a little telephone they have, but they usually write notes & pass them back as the observer has quite a neat little place to write or draw on as that is his chief duty. I took a few photos & hope they turn out well. I enjoyed my stay in Cairo very much though there is really very little  amusement there, but the real benefit lies in the change of food, clean comfortable beds, good  baths, & above all the mental change, meeting some one with different views who has seen something different from the unending monotony of the life here. 
I feel greatly benefited & quite satisfied to return to my work. I saw some of our wounded fellows in hospital & a good number of nurses & in connection with the latter stuck to the old rule that there is safety in numbers & trouble is thus avoided. to Am looking forward to a mail soon but they tell us that all mails now will go round via England & none direct so they will take a terrible time & will stand a very good chance of being sunk en route which is very wretched indeed. Goodbye my dear & very best love to all with your own usual & extra share from Your loving son Wilf.
