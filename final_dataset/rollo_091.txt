Just a hasty line to let you know I have  visited the 'Boltons.'  They are a tip top lot of people, and made  my stay with them most pleasant - I only wish  I had been able to put in more days there.  I will not attempt to give you all the news,  but will write a full a/c. when I get back to   the Battn again - but I visited several of the  clan about Liverpool.  I spent a very pleasant evening at Mrs Palmer's  place - No 6 Wynesdale St. Aintree. She was Jessie  Armitage - (Hannah's sister) & her husband Jack  is 2nd Steward on the Cunard's Carpathia.  I saw Will Armitage at Waterloo - (Lizzie and  met Sue & Kitty - then on to Letty's place. There  is a baby-girl 18 mths old - & her husband Arthur  Simpkins - has tried twice to join up - but a weak  heart has turned him down.  I have to catch the boat back to "IT" again early  tomorrow - so cannot write much more.  Zeps have been busy lately - 6 visited Wigan &  dropped bombs 18 mils. from Lpool - 15 last night.  People dread these visits a bit - as far more damage is done than appears in reports
