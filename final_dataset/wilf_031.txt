9th Light Horse Regiment, Heliopolis, 31. 1. 1916. My dear mother, The mail this week was rather disappointing as it brought me no letters but I fancy it was not a regular one but just a small batch, but on enquiring one night at the hospital if there were any letters for me I was presented with your cable which gave me great distress of mind on account of the needless anxiety you suffered. I knew that the illness of any officers from Gallipoli was immediately sent home but did not think that such a trifling indisposition as mine would be dispatched or I should certainly have anticipated the cable from the military authorities by one of my own stating the facts.   However I sent one the next day (Saturday) & hope that you received it today (Monday) & that your anxiety is quite past as it certainly would be if you could see me now, with my large waist almost bursting ^away the top button of my trousers.  We are now settled into the dull monotony of camp life at the base, each day very like the former & we do not go about very 
much as we have seen most of the interesting spots of Cairo.  But there were one or two very pleasant spots in this last week.  Yesterday afternoon I went in to see the Bryans of whom I have previously written, & spent a Sunday afternoon & evening which reminded me very forcibly & pleasantly of many that I have spent at home.  I went there about four oclock in time for afternoon tea.  They live in a flat above the business premises which is compact & cosy & very nicely furnished.  The building is a tall one of some six stories, the lower two being occupied by the business of the Bryans & the upper ones by several different families in flats which are reached by a lift.  The Bryans live on the fourth floor & also possess the top roof which is flat & where they have a small roof garden & have their breakfast & dinner in summer as it is almost unbearable in the hot evenings to sit inside. There was present at afternoon tea a Methodist Sister of the Rechabite Order, a woman of about forty who has been engaged for many years in work in the London slums & is now working in connection with the Methodist Church here.
She is a very pleasant faced woman of strong character & very interesting in her conversation about London & Manchester & their slums. She has worked a great deal among drunkards for whom she professes great affection.  We went along to the American Mission at six oclock & there I saw more people in mufti than I have seen in Cairo. There was a sprinkling of soldiery but the civil population predominated which is unusual here at present, a great many of them were American woman wh engaged here in mission work, among the natives. They have schools I believe where they teach English & try & convert the natives.  I must confess that the pastor did not appeal to me very strongly, but there was a very fine ^male quartette of Canadians from a hospital here.  They sang one of Alexander's hymns unaccompanied & sang it well.  After church we went back to dinner (Australian custom reversed) & we picked up a Welsh officer who is in private life a Methodist parson.  We sat down to a splendid dinner, soup, roast beef carved in English fashion & not in the beastly Egyptian way with potatoes & cauliflower then pudding of different kinds stewed fruit & blanc mange & steam pudding 
followed by nuts fruit & lollies. We then adjourned to the sitting room & the fire (for the evenings here are quite cool) & discussed tea & cigarettes.   We had quite a lot more talking & then I betook myself homewards. I was thinking quite a lot of you in church & of your Sunday evening in Candelo & felt quite sad to think how anxious you would be as my cable would not reach you until today & indeed you might not have it yet as we are some hours ahead of you as regards time.   On Saturday night Wesley & I went to Choubra Hospital where some of the nurses we have known, are stationed.   Wesley was particularly friendly in a Platonic fashion with a Sister Wield who has recently become engaged to one of the soldiers whom she knew well before & who seems a very nice fellow, & we wished to congratulate her.   She was a Prince Alfred girl & her example has been followed by another P.A. girl at the same hospital named Riordan so that we had double congratulations to offer.  We spent quite a pleasant 
evening with them there as a couple of others who had come over on the ship with us were also there & it revived old memories of Prince Alfred & our trip across.   One of the girls is named Corkhill & she comes from Tilba Tilba & is a fi cousin of the Bates family there & is well acquainted with the Collins & many Bega folk.   I forgot to mention that the Bryans were speaking Welsh a little & mentioned many dreadful & unpronouncable places in Wales & I wished from all my heart that father could have been there, he would have been in his element with Mr. Bryan who is such a fine old chap & is in the same line of business & very Welsh.  He says "No" just the same as father does.  They also happened to mention Aberaeron & Abarystwith & Miss Bryan was at school at the latter place. I rode all the way into Cairo on the day that I sent your cable as it was a glorious day & I had my horse saddled & thought I would prefer it to the tram.  I think my dear this is just about all the news I have to tell you.  The weather, at present, is glorious - I do not wonder that English people come here for the winter, the days are fine sunny & pleasantly 
warm & the nights quite cool.   I would like to go down to Luxor if I can manage it as one's stay in Egypt is not complete without doing so & our adjutant is moving in the matter so we may go soon in small parties, our Brigadier has just been & returned.   Much love to all the various branches of the family & with mother's usual share from Her loving son, Wilf.
