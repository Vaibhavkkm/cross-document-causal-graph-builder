 Dear Father &  Mother, – Just a few lines to let you know I am O.K. but extremely busy - just heard of a mail going in 2 days - & will try to get a real letter off then. We’re getting ready to have a good Xmas - will be out of the line then - so we are busy already arranging about Xmas dinner & a Sports Programme for Boxing Day. Must close now - with love & best wishes for good health, prosperity, & happiness from your loving son Rollo
