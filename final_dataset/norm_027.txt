 Happa Teppi  29th April 1915  Gallipoli Pensular    Dearest Mother & all at Home  We are in our Glory at  last & are under continual fire of the  Turks shrapnel & rifle fire; It is a  very wasteful expenditure on their  part as it only hits the Atmosphere  here & our positions are most safe  & excellently concealed. We landed  under the fire of our battleships &  altho' there was plenty of shrapnel along   the beach, we managed to get "A" Subs  gun into a high position on a hill &  he we at once got to work & located a  Turkish battery (6 Guns) & we gave  them a taste of direct fire & put them  completely out of action in 18 shots
This battery had been shelling the  landing parties along the beach &  were very annoying & the battleships  could not locate it & it was not until  we were firing in a different direction  that we discovered we were getting  it from them & our Major suddenly  located them & turned us on them.  Our Infantry got a terrible time  until we arrived & were being killed  & wounded by the scores by the Turks  shrapnel & I am glad to say that  our arrival put fresh heart into  them. We were the only Gun in  Turkish territory for 24 hours & we  were under fire from 3 different direct  ions & the snipers are the worst of   the lot, but we are quite safe & don't mind the shrapnel a bit. We  have had only 2 wounded in my  Sub, Powell, the Range finder, got hit  by a spent bullet & was a little  stunned. Jack Heywood was making  some tea & a bullet grazed his hand,  but he was most unconcerned about  it & went on making the tea after he  had made a few uncomplimentary  remarks about them. I must say   that the behaviour of my boys is  marvellous, they go about whilst  bullets are flying in all directions &  take not the Slightest heed of them.  Ammunition is plentiful & we fire  about 300 to 400 rounds per day.  We are all mixed up as batteries  & I am right away from the other 
guns of our battery. Moons gun is  about 3 miles from us attached to  the 3rd Brigade, & I am with another  gun of the 5th Battery. Colonel Johnston  got hit in the leg whilst washing &  our Dr got it in his "sitting down"  place, washing. The warships are  doing great work & are shelling  continuously & the "Queen Elizabeth"  with her 15 inch guns, shakes the  whole place when she fires & the noise  is deafening, but we like her music.  Our horses are still on the boat &  are not likely to land for some time.  The Indian Mountain Batteries are  doing good work & their mules carry  enormous loads up the steepest hills  without much effort. The British division 
landed at the foot of the peninsular  & we landed half way up, so you  can see that our job was by far  the hardest, but we are holding them  safe & are well "dug in" & there is  tons of barbed wire in front of our  trenches. We are under fire all  day & all night, but we all sleep  well as it nearly all falls into  the sea. We are very comfortable &  have good tucker, etc & the health  of all is splendid & I have never  felt better in my life. We all  assembled in Lemnos & after a  weeks stay, sailed for here & at day  break, the battleships were pouring  in broadsides & it was a sight  I'll never forget. Aeroplanes & seaplanes were flying all over the  place & we could here the Turks  machine guns trying to bring  them down, but to no avail.  We go down to the beach for  a swim in the afternoon, so  you see, this isn't too bad, eh.  I intend to give this letter to   anybody going back to the boat  & one of the crew will post it,  otherwise it will be censored.  It is great to see the war  boats standing off & firing   over our heads. Truly the  British Navy is wonderful.  The Queen "Lizzie" got onto the  Turks-German Armoured train &  blew it sky high with her 15 inch  guns. Men, guns & train was scattered in  all directions. They had been  doing a lot of destructive work.  The weather here is delightful  & we have had only one little  shower for about 3 minutes since  we arrived.  At the present minute, 4 war   ships are firing right over our  heads to the forts on the other   side of the Pen^insular, They are the  Triumph, Prince of Wales, Queen;  & "Buccaneer" & the noise is  deafening. That is the advantage  to us of the place being only 5  miles wide. We expect to be  here for a week until the other  division drive up the Turks from down below, then we   press them into a position &  blow them to "blazes".  Now Mother, dear, don't be  alarmed for us, as we are in  a strong winning position, &  altho' the Infantry have lost  a lot, there are no casualties  whatever with the Artillery, &  the Turks are retreating every-  where. I hope all are well  Give my love to everybody &  don't forget our "dinner".  With fondest love  I am  Your loving son  Norman
