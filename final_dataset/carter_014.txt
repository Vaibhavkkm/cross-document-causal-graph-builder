All.SS Minnewaska  Port Mudros. 15/4/1915,
  My dear Father, I suppose these will be the last few days of  luxury -. when we leave this boat, which will  probably be in the face of the Turks, we have to carry  3 day's rations , full water bottle & all our gear.  Each man will have 200 rounds of ammunition  so they will be loaded up - 70 lbs per man.  The Generals etc arrived on board Friday ab 9 &  we moved off ab 7 next morning -  We were issued with large scale maps of the Gallipoli  peninsula. - The next day we were amongst  the islands - one - either Nikaria or Samos -  rose suddenly from the sea & had a large white  city near the top - & looked like some of those  illustrations we see in fairy stories. -  We have been practising landing operations.  all fairly excited - at least I am - & trying 
to keep quiet and calm. I have a volume of  Shakespeare (Comedies) with me - Its wonderful the  enjoyment you can get from reading the old chap  over & over & again.       

19/4/1915   We had a rather  good Church service yesterday, the padre excelled himself  Gen. Birdwood also gave an address.     23 April 1915  Dear Mother & Father  It is generally thought we will move   tonight.
