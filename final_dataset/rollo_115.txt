Text:  Dear Mr Armitage,-  I would like first to tell you how  sincerely I sympathise with you in your great loss by the  death in Action of your son Captain Harold Armitage 50th Bat.  The loss was felt very keenly by us here, for  your son was held in high esteem and respect. I know there  is nothing I can say to make the blow easier to bear, but I  do trust it will mean something to you to realise how gallantly  he fought, and give his life for the maintenance of justice and  freedom throughout the world.  I have seen his O.C. Col. Salisbury, & find  that the Battn letter sent by him was unfortunately lost  in the "Mongolia" - and he is sending you another - giving  full particulars of the action - & of his appreciation of your son.  Your boy fell at Noreuil a small French  village near Bullecourt. He had done much and excellent  service for us - and was "Mentioned in despatches" by F. Marshal  Haig - (Gazette June 1917) for his good work during the  preceding half year. Col. Salisbury has given you details  of his great share in all our heavy fighting on the Somme - but  I should like again to say how much we regret his loss, which  is a great one to the A.I.F.  With my kind regards, and deep sympathy  Yours Sincerely  W.R. Birdwood.   From Gen. Sir W. R. Birdwood  1st Anzac Corps.
