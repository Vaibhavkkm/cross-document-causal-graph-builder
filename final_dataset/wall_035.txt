In France  31/1/1917   Dear Mum  Well old lady & how are you dodging along at present very well I hope we are having a very fair time & I am very well but by jove it is cold over here. it has  been as low as 15o below zero & all the roads &  fields & every thing is frozen in fact I can tell  you our Australian moon is a long way warmer than the French Sun. I can tell you there is snow  on the ground now that fell over a fortnight ago. But we get a bit of skating & hockey on the ice & we don't half get some tumbles. We are going into the line for a few days & I can  only hope that the cold snap keeps in & everything gets keeps frozen because ithe mud is 10 times better  frozen than muddy. You said in your last  letter that Jack was going to Myponga for his holidays well I hope that he had a good time but I fancy it would be a bit quiet for him. I havn't seen Bob here in France yet but hope to soon so love & best wishes to all from, Wall. XX
