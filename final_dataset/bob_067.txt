My dear Mum,  Excuse pencil paper etc but it is so cold that I do not feel inclined to leave the fire. Had made all arrangements to leave the hospital  tomorrow in fact booked at a room at the Jermyn Court hotel Piccadilly where I intended to stay for a while until I had my medical board & found out how much leave I get  Asked the doctor to sign my papers for discharge to-day he had a look at my leg and said he would recomend me for light duty told him that was no good to me stuck in camp somewhere  in England he said  if I went back to France now it might break down again still I do not believe him it feels quite strong again now however he induced me to wait and see the specialist who operated and get his advice tomorrow on the matter shall let you know later the result Feel as if I could go back  now but will not do so against his advice. Of course am still simply having the time of my life  the trouble is it costs such a lot of money and one simply cannot go out without spending money in London. So you see I am keen  to get back & do some  work also save some money. Then you know my dear one is contracting bad habits you know when one can go out when one likes and  come in when one likes nothing to do all day and a little money to spend how simple it is to get contract bad habits especially in London Still have looked at things from the proper  standpoint to date but after this long spell shall  find it hard to settle down to work again Have finished up with the dentist now thank goodness and hope to have no more trouble with my teeth for the duration Any how while at dinner two nights ago there was  a terrific explosion The conclusion was that bad windows crashed etc  thought it was bombs from a Zepplin but proved to be a munition factory blown up almost 3 miles  away.  The damage & loss of life was bad but of course very vague information has come through they cannot  say much about these things in the press at the present time Have no more news for the present  Trust you are all well at home love to all, Bob
