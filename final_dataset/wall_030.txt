9th Cadet Battalion. Gailes Camp Ayrshire
Dear Mum, I suppose you have been thinking that I have been forgeting you snow that I am in Scotland, but you are wrong. I am having a rare old time to be sure. plenty to do & plenty of time to do it in. We are getting plenty of  I work to do but I don't mind, in fact I rather like it. We get a fair amount of leave & we can go to pretty well any place in Scotland. We are about an hours run from Glasgow. We spent last week end there & we saw all the big shipyards on the Clyde & on the Sunday we were on Loch Lomond & by jove it is a bonny place. fancy me being over here seeing all these places it doen't seem real. But there is a lot of things about this war that doesn't seem real, I saw the Glascow University & all the places of note about Glascow, We are stationed about 6 miles from where Dad was borne at Stevenson & I have seen the house Dad was born in 
I had one of Dads Cousins showing me round & he wanted to be remembered to him. I am writing a long letter to dad this mail telling him all about it. I have not had a letter from I  you for over 6 weeks I suppose it is because I have been away from the Battalion. But Blanche sent me on her last letter from you & about Dads accident, by jove it is hard luck for us isn't it. You always seem to be having some sort of trouble or other mum. but never mind old girl, every cloud has a silvery lining. My word Bob seems to be in no end of trouble doesn't he, why don't he join up I can tell you it is quite the best thing he could do. I see by the papers that our chaps have been doing some heavy fighting lately my word I wish I were over there, but never mind I will make up for it when I do go over there or I will try to if I get half a chance at all. Is Ev coming over & seeing you occasionally or not, you 
see & write regular to me & if she doen't come over let me know & I will give her a scolding, how I wish I were there to do the soud scolding myself. There are some very nice girls over there by but Everill will do me & I'm not fussy. I will send dad's letter addressed to you & you can send it on to him. I do hope that he gets on alright. I hope that by the time you receive this that he will be well & about again don't you. I have seen Uncle Jim at Leeds & Aunt Finnie at Camphill & all the different married cousins up around here in our place is situated between a couple of places called Troon & Irvine & just at the back of us is a place called Kilmarnock & facing us the Sea & all the islands around the month of the Clyde. I have been at Dalry, Kilburnie, Dundonald. Prestwick Killwinning. The mother church of all Freemasonry is at Killwinning. When I got to Aunt Finnies place Uncle Jim
from Leeds was stopping there too & I can tell you he was busy showing me all about the place & he had us down upon the bowling green there & made us play & somebody took our names & a couple of days afterwards it was in the papers & if I can get hold of it I will send it home to you & you can send it on to dad. I am on guard just now when I am writing this & I can tell you that we get all sorts of jobs over here. Is Jack keeping well & in work I get letters from Blanche regular. I must close now with love to all at home from Your Loving Son, Wally. XXXX
