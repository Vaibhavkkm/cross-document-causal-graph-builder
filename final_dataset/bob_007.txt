9-10-1915 SOLDIERS CLUB CAIRO
Dear Mum. Do not get very much time to write in this place plenty of duty & work and when one is off there is plenty to do and see Hana and self are both well and looking forward to going to the front next Monday we were warned this morning to be ready at any time now. Shall be glad to get away from here in lots of ways although every thing is most interesting and instructive but am now keen to see action and also some other parts of this world. Cairo is indeed a gay, wicked, a fine city in parts of course it takes some time to get into the way of things and find out the best cafes' etc to visit then of course the difficulty of £. S. D arises. but on the whole have done very well. Have the whole of the day off so will be sight seeing this afternoon & well cannot say at present. 
what will be doing at night. Received your letter also one from Lorna a couple of days ago we were very glad to hear from you and all are well servant question still a trouble shall have to bring back some of these niggers or French am to say nothing of the French lasses. We are just going to have lunch at the St. James Cafe' a real fine place cost 20 pias tres without drinks piastres worth 2 ½ one is very apt to treat them as pennies. Cabs & taxis are one of the few cheap things to be had in this city so use them quite a lot of course there are plenty of nice things silks etc to buy but if one w shall probably be back here later if I have any luck best Love to all. Boby. Just called by a couple of the lads who are anxious to get away.
