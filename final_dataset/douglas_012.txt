Date: September 16th 1915.    I don't wonder Mater that you were so  upset when you heard of Douglas  Lennard's death. He was an exceptionally  nice fellow & a general favorite in  the Battery. The incidents connected  with his death were printed in the  West Australian & were remarkable  correct in every detail - even the words  spoken were correct. The official report  didn't do justice to the case - it just  stated the bare facts without giving  any details - which would make   splendid reading - for we all love to  read heroic acts & there would  be nothing more heroic than Doug's  death. The dear fellow! Now he is  beside seven of his comrades on our  own Battery graveyard. We have put
an inscribed cross at his head  & covered the mound with brass  fuse caps. It is a grave worthy of  the hero that lies at rest in it.
