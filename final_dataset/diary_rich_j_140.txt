November 27th.  Monday. I went across to Ribemont and saw Lieut. Biddie of Manly and Sydney, a Rugby Unionist. He was like most of the men just now with his view that there was no end to the war in sight at all. He even went as far as to say that we could never make Germany give way to defeat, they are too solid and clever. He was inclined to the opinion that the French would first give way and be the forerunners to peace. There is a good deal of reason in his idea from my own way of looking the matter up. If Roumania had only been able to hold out all might have been different. Now, with so much success all around I fear the Central Powers have a long lead and can hold all they have with very few men by building underground fortresses and using a few sniper and a large periscope which we must expose masses of men to drive them out. Those submarines are playing the devil with our ships while the casualty lists and Zepplin raids are breaking the hearts of our people. The German people are no doubt kept ignorant of the facts that are likely to dishearten the mass and so they are confident of victory and can show very good argument to back their confidence. I don't know, I'm sure. I cannot conceive that the Allies will be absolutely bested, but on the other hand I can see no chance of ever besting Germany, alas! This summing up does not alarm me one bit, because I can't see that a nation should have to win wars to live and to prosper.
