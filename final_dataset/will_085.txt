 HMS Lord Nelson,
  My dear General It is needless to tell you how pleased I was to get your  letter soon after Anzac day - I often thought of you on this day itself, and the wonderful way in which your lads forced their way up their hills and hung on to Them, I often wonder what would have happened if we had only had a few more Thousand men & had been able to reach the top of that 900 foot hill from where, if we could have held it, you could have commanded the  Turks line of communication & have spotted us on to the Forts While  they some ships pushed up the straights & attacked them from inside? However it is no good speculating now, and after all our sacrifices were not in vain. A Russian public speaker addressing a committee of workmen against making a premature peace said, they must remember what they owed to us “ how many Gallant English British & French  soldiers lay buried for our sakes in Gallipoli”. I have been a good deal on the move of late, have visited Athens and Corfu amongst other places _ Athens is much as usual, you would not think there was a blockade on, Affairs are still most unsatisfactory in Greece and so far we have all been pulling different ways _ I believe they
are making an effort now to co-operate better but  it seems to me they have got the wrong people out here to  do it - At Corfu We had a conference of Admirals to try  and improve the escort & patrol services in the  Mediterranean, I put forward some proposals which  were accepted by the Conference, but so far I do not  know how they have been received at home -  At ' Salonica', from where I am writing this, we are  attacking on the whole front which extends for about 200  miles. The Principal British Attack is between Lake Doiran  and the Vardar, as it is an extremely difficult job as it is  all very mountainous & our men are not accustomed to hill  fighting , so far we have been partially successful, but have  lost a good many men, on the Struma, the right flank  of which I am supporting with my monitor & blister cruisers,  we are holding our own, but the fever season is beginning  & I am afraid we shall have a lot of men down with it  before long - on the other side of the Vardar & round Monistir  The French, Italians, Russians & Serbs & Greeks are continually  attacking but are making very little head way - Monistir  is still being bombarded - I suppose an attack on all  part of some General plan, otherwise I dont see what  Good They are unless the Russians & Romanians are  going to make a good push when the Thaw sets in.
However like you in France we are killing off Bulgars &  Bosches - at the Dardanelles they have mounted some  by guns & are trying to bombard me out of the straits  Mines are of course being laid every where - after I had  arrived at Corfu they laid a line of mines to catch me  on my way back, but fortunately I got wind of these  & so came back another way - The Germans sent a  very strong bombing squadron out here & they have been doing  a lot of damage to the Hospitals & dumps at & round Salonica  As the army machines were weak & not numerous I got  Milne to let me form a combined "Army & Navy" Squadron  fighters & bombers and they have been very successful  & have broken up the Eurwigs Squadron-  I am now collecting up all the Generalist Troops from  all the Aegean Islands, We hope in the course of the next  few weeks to make the Greek army up to 50 or 60-000  Good, bad, & indifferent - We follow your movements  in France very closely and quite hope to see the  Germans out of France this Summer- I think it is  wonderful the way we turn them out of their trenches  & dug outs and I can only hope that our losses  will continue to be small in comparison with those of the Germans - How you must all be looking  forward to the Summer after the dreadfully long  cold muddy winter - I Presented some decorations &  medals to our French allies yesterday for good  service during the Dardanelles operation, I suppose it is our  Admiralties way of doing things but it struck me as  rather a long time after the event-  I hope you will write to me again when you find time  I am always tremendously interested in all your doings  on the Western front.  with every good wish, and please give my kindest  remembrances to any of my old friends and  wishing that success & good luck will follow the Anzacs  wherever they go   Yours very Sincerely,  Cecil F Thursby
