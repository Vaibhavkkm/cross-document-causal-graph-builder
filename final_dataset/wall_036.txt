In France 1/1/1917   Dear Mum  Well old lady it is New Years Day  today & I can assure you I wish I were home to be at the Regatta. But I am having a  good time for all that, pretty slushy & muddy but we are as happy as larry for all that.  I had a letter from Bob yesterday & he seemed alright & expected to be sent to  France about Christmas time so I will apply for his transfer to my Batt But I  don't know if I can manage it or not yet but I will have a hard try. Well I got back to my Batt alright & also to  the same Company. But by jove there is  a lot of differences in it. The Batt has been through 4 hard fights & lost very heavily. I  can tell you I hardly knew a one of them well you can judge for yourself there are only 20 men in the Batt who have been through  all the stunts & came out scot free & to hear some of the tales well some are simply  awful. My platoon Sgt has been through it 
all & I will tell you just one little instance.  Our Batt made an attack & after they took the place there were no officers left in the piece of trench in which this Sgt was & he only  had 10 men with two machine Guns when  the germans made a counter attack right along the line & this Sgt had roughly 600 Germans attack his line & he started to mow them down & just after he started & got about a 100 down the rest  put their hands up but as he couldn't  look after 500 germans with at only 10 men he went on cutting them down like wheat & when  there was only about 70 left he took them prisoner & I could you dozens of instances so you can see they don't have it all their own way. We are at present putting down  a cable on the Somme Front & we are working  in some of the places where the hottest of  the fighting took place. Guinchy High Wood  & Delville Wood & lots of other places & you can see dead Germans lying everywhere.  & a good few of ours. But our artillery is splendid. They gave them a good bombardment last night at 12 oclock & I can tell you it is 
great to see the sky lit up like the day with  the flash from the muzzles of the guns & the bursting of the gu shells. I wouldn't be away  from it again for worlds if I can help it. I havnt had a letter from Blanche  since I joined up the Batt & I havnt got  my photos yet but I am expecting them at  any time now if I don't get them soon I will   get Blanche to go up & shake them up  because they have been ordered over a month  now & I think that is long enough especially  as I have paid him for them & to cap it all  I lost my pocket Book with his address on  it but I can direct Blanche to within a few  doors of it. How is Dad getting on & yourself & Jack, all well I hope. Has Ev been over to  see you lately. I may be sending a parcel of  souvenirs soon & there may be a couple of  bombs amongst them but they will be quite harmless because I shall take all the explosives out of them. Well I must push off now with love & best wishes for a bright & Merry X New Year. I am  Your Loving Son, Wally  XXXX
