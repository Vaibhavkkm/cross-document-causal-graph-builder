December 20th, 1915. Dear Mum. Just a line or two to let you know that I am still alive & kicking & quite well & I hope you are all the same at home. We are not allowed to say where we are, or any movement that we make. on account of the very strict cencoring that is going on just at this present time. Mum I think you will get this letter a month later than you should do, as they say no letters will be allowed to leave here for a month so I suppose I will have you rousing at me in your letters for not writing but I write pretty regular. I hope that Bob & Jack are keeping in good work, & I hope there is plenty doing for all hands. I have not received any letters from you since the one you wrote on  the 7th of Oct so  you can see that we don't get our mail very regular. It is now only 5 days off Christmas I must close now with love to all & best wishes also from "Wally" Tell Eve to look on the back of her letter
