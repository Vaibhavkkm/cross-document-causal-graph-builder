April 4, 1918 – Left at 8:30 a.m. for the trenches. Went to Armentieres. Stopped in the ruins of houses while a strafe was on. While there got small unit of gas which had all sneezing & shedding tears. Went up & down trenches for 2 or 3 miles. Visited two dressing stations. Seemed very quiet but had blown up in part of the trenches earlier in the a.m. Did not see an undamaged building in Armentieres. Returned at 1 p.m. very hungry.
