 We laid our wire ok but Cox stopped a bullet 9.15 right through his stomach - but tho in great pain he took it like a Briton - he was one of my old platoon.  Nos. 9 & 10 have done most of the wire laying so far At present I am acting OC of C Company - but I will be out again tonight to finish the wire -as I don't like asking the men to do a risky job without  doing my share too. I read my mail. The weird contraption Wrumps sent as a head dress - I will wear it tho ‘ it gives no protection to my facial adornment.  Lots of correspondence to answer so will close. Sox are ok.
