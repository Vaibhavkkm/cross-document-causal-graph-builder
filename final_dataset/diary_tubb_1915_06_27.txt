 Got up early & arranged things
to get away - I did not like saying good bye to my men Left camp at 8.20 & reached 1st Aust Division Base at Mustapha at 9.30 and reported to Col Johnston who told me to go aboard the Minnetonga at once - After a deuce of a hunt (I met Frank at the Majestic Hotel) we found that the Minnetonga was not along side a wharf but out a bit Then we hunted up the Embarkation Office of the Aust Division found the embarkation officer (Lt Brice) who informed us that the Minnetonga was not leaving to day at all. Got in touch with Col Johnston and told him & then received orders from him to report again at 9.30 tomorrow morning - So here I am at the Majestic (writing this) where I am staying to night so as to be handy to report in the morning. I have packed & sent all my baggage to the Base & have only with me web equipment & water proof sheet & one blanket.
Frank has just left for Mena camp - We put in a grand afternoon with Capt Bannister 4th AL.H. & Lieutenants Wright Smith & Miller British Army) We went to a pigeon match at Moharrem Bey I won one event right out & shot second in two others - We had a real good time & I came out ahead of it. I am writing postcards home & to relations. It is very warm but a nice breeze is blowing
