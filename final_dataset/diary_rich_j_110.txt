March 17th. Saturday. Morning parade:-- Baths 2 hours. Lewis Gun. Afternoon parade:-- Physical T. and Bayonet fighting. Section drill. 5.30 lecture on "Venearel Disease." Dr. Appleyard after a few words on precautions against veneral  decided to postpone his lecture as he had no time to complete it thoroughly. We were expecting to gain a lot of information and advice to transmit to the men moreso as Major Harris announced the lecture yesterday and laid especial stress upon the great good it could do. We have a new physical instructor, he rolled into us like a whirlwind, and in bayonet work talked the spirit and religion of the bayonet preaching blood, guts and ginger. He revelled in his work and gave us a rough time. Talking the whole time like a "cheap jack." He is however going to teach us a whole lot of good stuff. The Lewis Gun instructor mentions that there are three stoppages only with a Lewis gun. No. 1 stoppage:--Cocking H. in forward position. (a) Empty space in magazine. (b) Worn or broken feed paul and spring. (c) Worn or broken stricker. (d) Broken paul spring. No. 2 stoppage:--C.H. over thumb piece on safety catch. (a) Friction in gas chamber or working parts.

No. 3 stoppage:--C.H. behind front piece on safety catch. Faults in feed due to breakage or weakness, or faulty section of cartridge springs.
