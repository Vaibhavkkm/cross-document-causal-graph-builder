 My dear Mum, Have just seen the procession  in connection with the opening of parliament it was all very interesting and of course  the most interesting part to me was that I had an excellent view of the kn King  and Queen who drove in an open carriage We were invited to some mans office  to see the show very nice too tea, coffee sandwiches whiskey & soda was served to  us in the meantime then saw the  whole show again on its way back  to the Palace from the street in fact  was quite close to Cousin George as Uncle  Evan would say so had a good look  at him also the Queen it was all  most interesting Had lunch in Town with Humphrey Browning after the show some little 
chop house I have discovered in London behind the Regent Palace hotel no show no tablecloth but the best cooked meal  I have ever tasted and the price quite  moderate.  Am just off to the Hon. Mrs  Edwards for afternoon tea and staying on  for supper afterwards. Have another afternoon stunt tomorrow afternoon so socially am  pretty busy at present Mum have you  yet received a little photo I sent to  you from Liberty's London it should  have reached you about Xmas time  would like to know before leaving  London paid war risks and all sorts  of things on it hope you get it  all right. Shall probably leave hospital  about this day week then allowing for  about a fortnights leave should be on  my way back to France about the end  of this month lots of love to all, Bob.
