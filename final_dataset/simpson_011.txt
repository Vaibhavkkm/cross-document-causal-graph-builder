January 3rd 1915.     Dear Mother  Just a line to let you know that  I received you Xmas Cards and one from  Annie. It was very kind of you both  to send me my Xmas Cards I got  them yesterday morning I am glad  to hear that you and Annie are keeping  well for I am keeping well enough  here considering the grub we get  but I have lost a good bit of weight  since I first joined the contingent  I am sorry that there is not much news to tell you from here for  life is pretty much the same here day in and out it is just the  regular routine work of the chumy marching and drilling it is not  a bad sort of a life taking it all  up together at any rate it is a much  easier life than working ones life out in the stokehole  But  everybody is wishing they would
make a move out of this place  either to England or the front I would like to have a month  in England before we go to the front I see that there has been  another English battleship lost in the channel  That is a bit  more that we the British will have to take out of Germany's  hide for she knows now that it is only a matter of time with her  I see by this morning's paper that Australia is going to send  another 100 thousand men I am not surprised for men were just  simply going mad out there to go to the war There was many a man  envied us first contingent men for being so lucky & get off to  the war Well mother I think that I will now - draw to a close  so with love to you and Annie I remain your loving son Jack
