 (Dear Mabs birthday)    Dearest Mother & all at Home.  Just a line to let you  know that I am quite well & enjoyed Xmas immensly.  I have simply been overwhelmed with good things  & presents, & it has been the surprise of my life, &   being a stranger in a strange land, I expected  to have a very quiet time, but friends have come  suddenly on me from everywhere & loaded me  with all kinds of things, and invitations to  Xmas dinner in galore, which I was compelled  to decline. One of my bombardiers (Arthur Maure)  who is in England told his friends of my whereabouts  & I got a lovely invitation from them (I am sending  you the letter) & they offered to fetch me in their Car.  When I wrote and thanked them profusely, & told  them that I was still confined to bed, they at once  came & visited me. One young lady in great furs  Etc, & an Elderly lady who introduced herself as a  Miss someone or other, & they made such a fuss  of me that I though I should spring out of  bed. And I didn’t know what to say of course,  & felt an awful fool, & being in a very shy mood, I could not look them in the face, & here
were they piling parcels of sweets & fruits & books  and magazines on my bed, & at the same   time telling me how sorry they were to think I  couldn’t come to their place, & that Papa would   be awfully disappointed & I don’t know what  Mother will say & all that kind of thing. Well  what could I do or say. You can just picture  me there in bed like a big galoot just born.  They stayed all the afternoon & made me promise that I would come & stay with them on  furlough & they would come & bring me in their  Car, & Papa would take me to his country farm  & goodness only knows what they didn’t say  to me. After they went & I had recovered from   the shock, I began to open the parcels & I was  as nervous as a thief. Here was a tremendous   box of chocolates (great big ones too), a box of choice   oranges, a whole tin of beautiful short bread, a   box of caramels, & toffee & 2 great boxes of Bon  bons, & Magazines & Papers too numerous to   mention. The bon bons simply knocked me  rotten. I can’t imagine why they gave me these.  I thought they were only for kids parties, &  I asked the Nurse, & she said of  “Oh Xmas   is not complete without them”.  I put my  head under the clothes & simply roared. 
Awfully decent of them, wasn’t it.? Then  a brother of one of our Sergeants who lives in  England & works at the War Office, came &   brought me a host of sweets & fruits & Cigarettes  & an invitation to their place when I go on  furlough. Then Lady Almonde came & gave  us each a parcel containing a cake of chocolate,  a pipe, tobacco, cigarettes & such like, & spoke   very nicely to us; Then the Red Cross people   came & more tobacco, fruits, sweets poured   onto Normans bed.  Then the Postman came   & brought letters, Christmas Cards Etc, from all   kinds of people, Sir George Reid, Lady Birdwood,   Australian Defence people, Red Cross people,   Australian visitors in England, & from Julia,   & Harriet as well, & from some of my chaps  in other hospitals.  Our ward was decorated with holly &  green stuff, & mistletoe was hung over all  the doors, & there was a great deal of kissing  of nurses, sisters, matrons, & visitors, & games  & music & dancing was indulged in till  all hours next morning.  The Dr let me  up for Xmas day, but I was sitting by  the fire nearly all the time & took very little  part in the festivity, but we all enjoyed 
ourselves immensely. Dinner was of Chicken  Roast Pork (no stuffing tho’) baked spuds & cabbage   & Plum Pudding & Custard to follow.  Not too   bad eh? All the same I was thinking of  home & everybody, & wished that next Xmas  I might be home with you all. I’ll supply   the dinner, now don’t forget that please.  A few more patients arrived from the  Dardanelles last night & they were all Tommies.  No more Australians are coming to England till  after the winter. Snow fell the other day & it looked very nice. I still write regularly to  Gravesend & they always answer affectionately.  How did you all spend Xmas? I hope   you all enjoyed yourselves. I have had no   mail from Australia since September. I have not been able to write to any of my many  friends in Victoria & would feel glad if you  would kindly let them know of me. I hope you  got my Cable. The Dr says that we must not   try to get well too soon, as we are here from for a long   time & will get 6 weeks furlough. Well Mother dear,   I hope you are all well; Give my love to them   all & tell Mab that I’ve been thinking of her today.  Best love to Mab, Chas, George, Rupert & Floss &  to all relations & an extra big whack for yourself   from your loving son,   Norman.

May Tilton is, I believe, in Cairo.  I met a nurse  who came over with her on the "Orontes"  Jack Tilton is in the 5th Battery so I’m told.  I do not know where the 1st Australian Division is going to, but I expect  Suez Canal.
