My dear Mum, Am very busy we will be in it again very shortly again now Major Murray is across in England so that I shall be in charge of the Coy in this next stunt. Had help into the line yesterday to have a good look around it was most interesting but very rowdy of course I am unable to tell you anything about it suffice it to say there will be lots doing here very shortly now however you never know your luck We are quite close to the  line now and expect to move closer still in. a couple of days. There are many interesting things happening here day by day only wish I could tell you all about them but one must be most careful what one writes these times so you will understand the reason for this short and rotten letter
Am in the best of health and feeling quite OK. my mouth troubles me a little occasionally but nothing much am always too busy to think about it studying maps, meetings, running the Coy etc one gets very little time to ones self. Hope Nana does not get back to his battalion until after this stunt they will be up against it I think and will get some hot work. have you heard from him lately? expect he is all right. lots of love to all, Boby.
