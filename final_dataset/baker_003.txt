13/4/1916 Somewhere in France My own dearest Sister I received a letter  from you dated 18/3/16 & later 3/4/16   the other day & I'm so sorry you didn't get my letter;  but better   luck this time. You see by the above   your belief about Kut was wrong. I say it was hard luck you did not see me on the  pictures;  but I am willing to bet any money the pictures of the landing at Sulva Bay was an absolute "fake".   Can you imagine they would allow any cinema photographer to be present at an important move like that. I received your "Punch"   & its fine. I wish those beastly "Zepps"  would leave you alone, they are  troubling Molly a bit I think. It was lovely to hit a bit of land so like old  England & after we left Marseilles  in the train I saw a lot of wild  Violets & primroses & Cowslips & the   boys thought I had gone "dilly"  I was so excited at seeing them again  I am glad you have had  beautiful weather, as we are having   a horrible wet time just now.  I say its not a bit of  good me trying to write. I keep  on getting interrupted &  now my  "caboosh" is being raided by a lot  of serjents who want to warm up  & are all talking & laughing & absolutely  refuse to let me write  So good bye for the present  Fondest love to all  Ever your loving brother,  Ernie.
