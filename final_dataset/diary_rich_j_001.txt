Location: Barracks Camp.
Nationality: Australian.


Friday October 2nd Leave from 5. to 9.p.m. Called the camp at 5.30 this morning so that the tent orderleys can go on parade and still do their work. This is unecessary if everybody was honest & willing The Colonel announced that there would be no further leave granted and special leave only until 9.pm. in very important cases. The ruling is certainly annoying and is brought about by the drunken misbehaviour  of the infantry crowd who are to be seen in the streets at all hours of the night. Special police have been engaged to clear the town. I went to Manly with Annie Stout and saw Mrs. Hynes. about her getting a room down there. I enjoyed the trip immensely and gave me a fountain pen. Camp by 9 o'clock.
