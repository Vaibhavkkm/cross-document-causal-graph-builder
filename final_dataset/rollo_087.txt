Text:   We have now left the Somme Area and are on our way to the  Ypres Salient. and we are Reserve now. We will have about five weeks rest here, in order to re-train & re-organise & generally  to do all we can to make ourselves as Hydras.  I will give you a short description of our stunt of 1st week in Sept., & forward a rough diagram to show positions.  In our previous stunt (12, 13, 14) Aug. my  Company took & consolidated the line E.F.  and tried to dig the line A.B. but had  to retire through lack of support to E.F.  This time the whole Brigade were put at Mouquet & 9th had  to take C.D. 50th in support of Park Lane E.F. 51st had to  attack AB., & 52nd B.C.  We reached Park Lane on the night of the 2nd & took the chance  of re-digging & deepening the line - in some places 9’ deep so  as to be safe from the ‘hate’ of Fritz when the stunt opened.  At dawn on the 3rd the attack started - each battalion was  successful in reaching its objective - though all had a very  rough passage. Almost at once I had to send a platoon with  a couple of Lewis guns to point B - & here my boys did good work.  In fact C.O. Of 5 has recommended Cheney who took up the  party for honor. About 9 a.m. the 52nd fell back on our line E.F.
