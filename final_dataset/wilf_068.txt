15.10.1916 My dear mother, Just a few lines this time as conditions are not very good for writing. I am attached temporarily to a Camel Corps here which developed a case of infectious disease & I came over from the Ambulance for a few days to see that they take proper measures to  prevent its spread. I hope to return in 2 or 3 days time as I don't care much for treating Gippys. These Camel Transport Corps have attached a kind of student doctor - there is a Russian here & they can't be trusted to do things when special measures need to be taken.  I am about 3 miles from the Ambulance, have 
only been here two days & hope to be away again in same time. Since I last wrote we have moved a few miles further out - mores the pity but hope soon to be relieved & have our spell. I am in an uncomfy position laying down & have no news so will defer more till next time. Much love to all and a kiss for mother from This loving son Wilf  Will write again
