Dearest Mother & Father,
This is my third day in Egypt
and second in Cairo. I chanced 
to be in the city this afternoon and on entering
the Y.M.C.A. Gardens I was struck
by the notice "Mail closes for Australia
at 4 30 p.m.," so I thought I would
write you a few words. I have only 
half an hour in which to do it.
I spent yesterday afternoon walking
round the city sight seeing. It is a
strange place at first to an Australian,
narrow streets, and tall white buildings
and thousands of native urchins
and vendors worrying you at every
turn to clean your boots, sell you 
a cane, post cards or souvenirs of Egypt.  I find it is good policy to
have your boots clean and to carry 
a cane; it saves you endless bother
saying ishmi "imshi" ("clear out")
I went along all the main streets
and saw the chief buildings in the 
heart of the city, including the 
famous Shepheard's and Continental
Hotels. They are magnificent buildings
and it is only permitted of officers 
and nurses to enter. I continued
along the street in which they are
till I came to a bridge over the 
Nile ( You have a P.C. of it, which Les 
sent - a tall native policeman standing
in the street in the foreground) The
Nile is a splendid broad stream at
this place. On the other side there are
fine gardens along the bank. Here one 
sees many of the well educated Egyptians
reading and walking (some arm in arm) This writing place is in the open
air alongside a skating rink on
which there are always dozens of
brawny sun-tanned Australians flying
round playing hockey. There are
also a good tea rooms in the vicinity
where one can enjoy good tea and
coffee and good cake.
They are singing out that the 
mail is about to close so I shall 
have to stop now.
With love to all,
Your loving son, 
Jim.
P.S. I am trying to locate Les
through the Base Records' Office.
I shall shortly know his whereabouts.

Zeitoun
Cairo, Egypt.
