A Concert in France 
Author: Robert James Henderson.

Date: 25.7.1917  1 Just a concert in a barn Somewhere out in France, One man tells a yarn For there's no room to dance 2 Another says something about A "Toe rag in the stew," It makes everyone shout From the Captain to the Crew 3 Fighting Harry he is there Bob Henderson's there too Dan Sheahan's done his share With "The Toe-rag in the stew." This is how the day was spent And that's how fun was made Instead of with our shoulders bent And a route march as parade. L. Cpl. W L Blow
This was made up by one of my chaps while the Concert was on in the barn during a wet day RJH
