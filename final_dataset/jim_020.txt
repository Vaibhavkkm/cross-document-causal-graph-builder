 No. 1 Command Depot,
                                                              Sutton Veny,
                                                                  Wiltshire,
                                                                                  9. 9. 1918.                                     
 
My dearest Mother & Father,
Long before you receive this letter, which
I write with a heart ready to break, You
will have heard that poor old Les has
made the supreme sacrifice for his country.
I have been expecting this sad news
for ten long days and nights, the
tension during the last day or so being
almost unbearable.  When you hear of
the nature of his wounds you will know,
as I fully realize now, that it is
better so.  I had a wire from London
this afternoon to say Les died at the
8th Gen. Hosp. Rouen yesterday.  I have tried
ever since leaving hospital (6 days) to 
get leave to get across and see him,
but had not got a definite decision
up till getting the wire today.
Now I hope, dear parents,  you will
take a brave view of our misfortune,
and try to derive some consolation in
knowing that Les died in the most noble and honorable way, in defence
of a his country, fighting in an
unquestionably just cause.  It is
true that we only realize the most
fearful and cruel aspect of war when
our own blood is involved, and
when sons are lost to their parents,
and brothers to sisters and brothers.
 I thank God Les had not a
wife and kiddies depending on him.
You must be thankful you have still
sons and daughters to be some
comfort to you.
I feel too upset to write further
tonight, but I shall write again in
a day or so, when I am more at
ease.   The memory of our last
parting; the few brave words and
strong grips; are is too fresh.
Rest assured I shall find out
all the news I can and let you
know as soon as possible.
I shall not be leaving England
for at least a month, perhaps not
at all now.
          Love to all from
                       Your affectionate son,
                                  Jim.                       1 DRL474 1/2
 
[*P.S. I do not forget dear Ruby is 20 today. 
It is a most shocking day here, a driving
wind and rain in torrents.    Jim.*]
