 My Dearest Mother, & all at Home;  As there is a   mail for Australia closing to-night, I may as   well write a line, altho there is really very  little to tell you, - still a line is better  than none at all I suppose.  It is now more than  3 weeks since I got a letter from Australia, & I  am wondering whether "Fritz" has sunk some of   our boats, - if so, then thats all the more we   have against him. I am just bursting for  news of home, & I really cannot describe  what joy it is to get news of you all, & I must   say that you all have been extremely kind to me  in writing so much to me, & sending so many  parcels.  The weather here now is not nearly so   cold, but we have had some rain, & the   place is a quagmire, but we are well booted  & cloaked, & every man has since had a  water proof cape issued to him, & I already  have my fine oilskin, so have nothing to fear.  We are having rather bad luck with our  horses, as skin disease is just sweeping thro'  the whole stable, mostly mange & ringworm,   & we have to isolate & treat them continuously,  & the pharmacy won't give the farriers the  necessary ingredients for washing the horses.  My farrier sergeant came & told me the other day
that the N. C. O in the "Tommy" pharmacy,  refused to supply him with the stuff, and  said that "we blarsted Australians were  only here on suffrance", so I went down to   him at once, & charged him with it, & asked  him what the devil he meant by it, - and   I also asked him did he mind the Australians  fighting & dying on suffrance in active service,  & I then enquired if he had seen service, and   he said "No, sir", - well I got to him  properly, & I wont tell you what I said to  him, as it is unprintable, but my farrier  got all the stuff he wanted, & a bit more.  The Australians have a very bad name  in England now, & we get accused of some  very terrible things at times, - for instance  there is a "Tommy" Reserve Brigade of Artillery  here, who are supposed to be training us, & this  Brigade has 3 batteries, & recently two of the   Q. M. Sgts got quarreling over something, & one  pulled a revolver & shot the other, who subsequently  died: at the Court Martial which  followed, the accused was asked why he was  carrying a revolver, & he replied "to protect  myself against the Australians", - and  he got acquitted. - That is honest truth.  I was told to find a patrolling picquet  of  1 Sgt, 1 N. C. O, & 8 men to patrol some   twopenny halfpenny village of 6 houses, last  week, & I enquired of the Tommy R. S. M.  what for, & he told me that we Australians  had been there frightening all the women  folk. - I, & an officer rode to the village  in question & made every enquiries, & every 
house-hold told us that the Australians never  come near the place, & that there was no truth in  the R. S. Ms statement whatever, so I went back   & told him what we had done, & he said that   the patrol would keep our chaps away from them  as they did not want the inhabitants molested,  so I told him off, & called him a -  liar, - and a _ to his face, & I charged   him with keeping 2 wives there (I already knew  this to be true, so knew what I was talking about)  & I threatened to expose him to the Colonel, &   he crawled right down, & said he'd promise to have  the patrol abolished. Oh! they are a dirty  crowd these people, Mum - they will sit &  drink as much beer & spirits as the Australians  will buy them, & then go outside & say all   sorts of rotten things of them.  Their dirty little  rotten Sgt cook brought his officer down to my   office the other day, & said "the Australians  had robbed his cookhouse", so I up & flew   at him, & asked him to account for certain  Xmas gifts that were sent into the cookhouse  for distribution to our boys, & also to account   how he has run our messing account into £12  debt, whilst that of the Tommies, (in the same  mess) was £3 in credit, & I dished him up a  few more of these little savouries, (& by this  time his officer had walked out) so I told  him that if he didn't clear to Halifax out   of it, I would throw him out, so he went  out without further ado.  Oh! yes Mum, I'm getting an irascible  old Sergeant Major, but I can't stand this sort of   thing. 
I received a letter from May Tilton yesterday  telling me that she had gone to Southall Hospital,  which meant France, so I expect that she has   got her desire fulfilled by now.  I still keep in   touch with Gravesend, & correspond regularly  with them. I sent them 10/- last week,  & £1 yesterday, & I will try & send them a   little now & then.  I was thinking of increasing  my allottment to you by a 1/- a day, so if   you get word about it don't be surprised.  I  will certainly tell you if I do.  4/- a day   is too much for me, & theres nothing to go & see  or buy in this place.  We had our new pay sig books issued this  last pay, & these books show how much credit  or debt we are in after each pay.  I posted the Will which I made on 4th April 1915, when  sailing for Gallipoli in the back of it. It is  made out all in your favour, of course, & in  the event of anything happening to you, it all  goes to Mab. This is should I go under of course.  It is the only will I have ever made.  Do you get my money alright? - You   never mention that you have any trouble in  getting it, so I take it that everything is O. K.  I wrote last week as usual, & hope   you get all my correspondence.  I haven't  heard from Ruby Davidson for months, so I  suppose she has "turned me down".  I hope you are all well. - My love   to you all  Your loving son  Norman.
