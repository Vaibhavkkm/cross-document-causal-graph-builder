Wednesday Oct 21st Last night the sky was fairly clear and the boys merry, the Bag-pipes and orchestra keeping them bright. At about 8.30 the Dean held a short service on the well-deck which was also a pleasant break in a day made somewhat miserable by the number of sad faces and sickly forms laying about in all directions. There does not appear to be anything like sufficient accommodation for the 2,500 3,011 odd men aboard. At 9 o'clock I had some bread butter & herrings before going to bed, at 2.a.m. I felt very bad and vomited freely. The hammocks are placed to close together yet the fellows like them & sleep well. Through some mismanagement or other there was no arrangement made aboard for the Army Medical Corps at all. So that we have just to squeeze in & make the best of a bad position. So far I have no regrets at having volunteered but I wish we were at the end of our destination, this ship life does not offer anything novel. The mess orderlies are having a rough time and by the growling that goes on the ship is generally unsatisfactory. This I hope will rectify itself as time goes on.
The wet canteen has met with general approval and is opened only between the hours of I1 & 12 am and it takes the full hour hard going to get finished with the long time of constantialy waiting men. The dry canteen is open from 7 to 8 in the morning & 4 to 5 in the afternoon 7 to 9 at night The rubber shoes supplied at 2/6 are scoundlous they pull away from the sole in ½ hours
wear. The dry canteens' prices seem far above Sydney prices all round. Tins of Toffee costing 6d in Sydney stores are sold at 1/-
