 I've seen Roy Hannaford (Cudlee Creek) who is in 9th L.H.  & I have a Mt Gambier & Kalangadoo boys here too  & for a while Bill Bagshaw's younger brother.  Is Benia still barracking for Norwood - I've the  elder Beanies here as a Corporal - but I haven't  heard of the Chamberlains putting in yet.  All operations here are at a standstill - nothing  doing except occasionally a few 'bombs' going.  Heard from Scott - who'd had a 'beastly' trip to  London in Hosp. Ship - but was being splendidly treated  in England - 'Aussies' seem to be favorites there. Rollo
