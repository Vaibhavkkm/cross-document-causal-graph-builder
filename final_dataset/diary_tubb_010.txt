Hard at it altering the plan of our Camp. Gen McGregor the Base Commandant inspected it last night and advised improvement Got letters from home of 25th April & one May 3rd. Glad to hear of the rain in April. Extremely sorry to learn of Mrs Locks death. The windmill must have got damaged. The Argus & Herald accounts of our doings are fair but do not state the full facts! We eagerly devour the home letters, & wish we go could get them regularly
 
Poor old Victoria and Australia. The loved ones at home are to be pitied Am glad to say that the majority of our wounded are recovering No word yet of my marching orders! No censorship on our letters now "till further notice" so our folk at home will be getting full accounts of our doings
