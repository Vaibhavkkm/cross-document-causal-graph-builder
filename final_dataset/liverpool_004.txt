Dear Sir William Birdwood, I have to thank you for your letter of May 22nd. just received. With regard to your question,whether I had a reply from the Secretary of State in respect to the use of cipher "V" I got a reply that it could be used at that time,but of course I had previously had an order that it was not to be used. I have very little news to give you from here,I have just inspected the 15th Reinforcements which will leave shortly, I hear good accounts of them from the side of discipline, but neither they nor their predecessors the 14th have had quite such a high musketry average as former drafts,it must not be forgotten however that the weather at this time of year is not of the best,and perhaps my remarks on this subject are a little prejudiced,as you are aware we were somewhat strictly brought up in the Rifle Brigade as to this. I think you will probably find that the officers, who are being sent you now,are somewhat better trained,as a longer
period is required of them namely 6 months for those who have had previous territorial training, and 11 months for those, who have not. Parliament is still sitting,but I hope that it will finish shortly,as the time of Ministers is very much hindered and this especially applies to the Minister of Defence, and the Department generally,however on the whole all goes well, though like everywhere else there are " disgruntles ". I am glad to hear from Sir John Cowans that the Hospital Ships are doing good work. I always feel glad to send you any information to you [[Txxyxx]] I can, as you are half a Lincolnshire man,like myself,at least through your wife With every good wish
Believe me Yours sincerely Liverpool.
