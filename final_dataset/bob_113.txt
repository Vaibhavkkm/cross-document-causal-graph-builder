 My dear Mum, What do you think of this flash paper picked it up in the orderly room. Received a  nice lot of letters when I returned from leave from you Jane Lorna Aunty  Polly Lucy Dag Billy which were great also a parcel containing cake tobacco sweets sugar for which many thanks fancy I get about  one in every half dozen you send but it cannot be helped. My leave was not up really in London until tomorrow
but was recalled last Wednesday there is nothing seriously wrong but we are expecting a big  show to come off shortly again and all officers were wanted so there you are and this sort of thing is all in the game. Have just  returned from church which we held in a paddock it rained and was bitterly cold so that I can assure you the service was far from being interesting. Afraid all the good weather has  left us for the next six months or so it has been cold and wet ever since I have returned. Simply had a splendid time while in England  the weather sen perfect fine and warm the whole time with beautiful moonlight nights every night I was there in London air raids from the Hun took place the bombs seem to follow me up. They are very nasty things and a considerable number lives were lost and damage was done no doubt you read all about them in the papers. Have not seen Nana yet but know he is kicking around here somewhere and quite well Colonel Marks & Major Murray were at dinner with the 45th the other night & told me he was quite OK. Well my dear no more news at present the war news is excellent at present and perhaps another 2 or 3 years at this rate may end all this business who knows. lots of love to all also a very Merry Xmas & a Bright New Year to everyone Hope you receive the little parcel I sent you from Liberty's OK, Bob.
