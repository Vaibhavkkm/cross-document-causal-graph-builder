Weather: very cold, dry Health: cold slightly improved
Up at 6:45. Roll call. Breakfast, cornflakes, bacon, hard boiled eggs, coffee. Wash, shave and make bed. Detailed to help clean latrine. My first detail in week. Dress for inspection by 9:00. Leave for 10 o’clock train. Train is announced two hours late. Read Zangwill’s “Ghetto Comedies” and play pool. Get away at 11. On train at 12. Surprised by newspaper announcement that mercury is between 6 and 13 below zero. Steel-frame, concrete floor cars are so cold that boys build fires of newspapers on floor to warm feet and do double time all the way home. Sam and I eat box of candy. Sam has very bad cold. Boys’ feet are frostbitten. Get home to Leah at 4:00. Happy again. Bertha and Joe and Goldstone there. Dinner. Call home and Mama. I have a lot to tell and complain about. Eat Leah’s first cookies. Good. Hetty, Harry, Hy, Mollie, Mike and Ben Diamond call. They play cards, victrola. Goldstone recites “Shamus O’Brien” and sings topical songs very well. I find that I grow tired if I stay awake after 9:00, so at 11:00, I announce that I wish to go to bed. Company goes. Leah and I talk shop and make plans for tomorrow. We say our prayers together, after discussing peace, talk in papers of today, in which Germany appears very anxious to conclude peace. Sleep poorly. Dreaming all night that I was back in barracks and that I have no right to sleep with Leah, whom I was endeavoring to put out of my bed or hide. It is very cold in bedroom and we find it hard to get warm.
