November 30th.  Thursday. Nothing that I can recall (Saturday Dec. 2nd) is worthy of note today, as I don't remember going away from the camp. I sometimes sit down to write but it is cold and to keep the fire alight (coal fire in an oil drum brazier) seems to occupy most of my time and attention. I try to get it burning brightly and free from smoke then take it inside the low shack but it does not last long and-in putting more coal on there is the dense black smoke again. The roof of the place, canvas, is now thickly coated with soot, in fact everything is black, clothes, hat and my neck always so, even immediately after washing same. Harry Dingle came into Camp today and he and myself are to join up with the 1st Battalion tomorrow.
