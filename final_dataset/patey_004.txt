 September. 2nd  1914 We arrived here this morning  and I find a mail is now leaving   for Sydney. So I will close this.  Our Army seems to be fighting splendidly  in France but terribly out numbered  We are now coaling. Will write again  when there is an opportunity but I am  afraid not for three weeks Will Bid  love to you all Your affectionate brother George E Patey.   [*Have not heard from any of you for a month*]
