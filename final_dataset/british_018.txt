Dear Gerald,
Many thanks for letter which was somewhat a surprise to me. No the news was quite fresh as I do not hear from anybody in the office.
We have just come from the trenches where we were for seven days and had a most awful time. We were three days in the Reserve and put in the firing line where we took part in an attack and were also under a very heavy bombardment.
I am sorry to say we had many casualties thirty five killed and one hundred and thirty eight wounded and I can assure you it was an experience I shall never forget. Anyhow Williams, Kemball and myself came out quite safely.
I have seen Frost out here, of course his battalion (8th Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders) are in the same brigade also, as a matter of fact, they were in the firing line the night we came out. I received a letter while I was in the trenches from Mr Slater. Yes, I heard about Chamberlain, jolly sad was it not, if you do hear from Dick James you might pass any news on to me…
Shall be glad to hear from you. I could write more, only am a wee bit tired after seven days in trenches.
I am yours sincerely, Fred Hull.
P.S. Of course you know my address. Remember me to all I know.
