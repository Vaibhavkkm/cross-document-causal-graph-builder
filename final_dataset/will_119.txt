MISSION BELGE  Décember 8th 1917.  GRAND QUARTIER GÉNÉRAL   BRITANNIQUE     My dear General,  I am delighted to inform you that His Majesty has been pleased to confer on you the Belgian Croix de Guerre; will you kindly accept my best and sincerest congratulations : no Soldier deserves more than you such an honour.  I hope that you had a good rest during your stay in England ; I read in the Court Circular that you had the honour of being received by your King.  You know that we are now again at Montreuil and neighbourhood (My mission is billeted in Neuville sous Montreuil). The distance from my Headquarters to
Fletre is unfortunately now much longer - but I hope however to be able to go and see you.  Yours very Sincerely,  Ad Orvy.  Liege
