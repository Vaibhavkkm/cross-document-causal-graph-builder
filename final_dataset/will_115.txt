The Counties Hotel, 185 Tottenham Court Road, London, W.C. 24th November, 1917.
To General Sir W.R. Birdwood, 1st Anzac Corps, Australian Imperial Force, France.
Dear Sir, I gratefully acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated October the 8th addressed to my son Lieutenant E. L. G. Rowell M.C. of the 25th Battalion. I regret to state he was wounded on October 14th, and I, together with my only remaining son, Lieutenant Athol G. Rowell of the 49th Battalion, was with him, when he died at St. Omer on November 15th. His condition was too serious for his attention to be distracted by any correspondence and he never had the consolation and comfort of your generous recognition. I received your letter from the Hospital Authorities after his death. Let me thank you, on behalf of my wife and myself, for your appreciation of the character and service of our boy. Your letter will be cherished by us as a most precious incident associated with his supreme sacrifice. Moreover, may I remark how proud we are that our boys should have served under you; and how thankful we are for the high toned ideals and spirit of chivalrous manliness inspired by their enthusiastic regard for your own personality. This feeling regarding your good self, is universal throughout the Commonwealth and is the source of real satisfaction in many stricken and anxious homes. I am, Yours very truly, R. Rowell
