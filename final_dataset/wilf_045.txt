 11th 5. 1916   My dear mother, Here we are again in the same spot writing in the same old way. I received one of your letters again this week & am glad to say that mail is coming fairly regularly now. Nothing has happened at all since I last wrote so that my letter will again be uninteresting. Wesley & I went into the xxx (I forgot & almost put something censorable), at any rate we went in & had a dip one day this week, you will probably guess where. It was exceedingly enjoyeable as the weather is warm & the water delightful & we splashed & floated & swam to our hearts' content. We then called on Roy Winn (one of the Newcastle Winns) who is a medico in a battalion near there & dined with him met quite a lot of fellows & rode home in the moonlight afterwards. Of course I had to stop with Wesley for a while & have a corroboree for a few minutes at his camp before coming on. The next day Winn & another fellow came along & had lunch with Wesley & visited me later 
in the afternoon. Beyond that I have  practically done nothing beside my duties here  all week & the chief trouble is the monotony.  I have very little to do & sometimes it is difficult  to fill in the time but still it passes away & the  end of the war grows nearer. Wesley came  out to dinner tonight & has just left & then  Jaques came along & had a yarn & smoke.  I rose at 3.30 a.m. this morning & am feeling  rather weary but that was an exceptional  practice for me & at any rate I'm going to  doss early though I had an hour this  afternoon. Nothing further to tell you my  dear - I do hope you are keeping brisk &  well so that you will be in good health  & spirits when I return. Best of love  to all & an extra lot for mother from  Her loving son (who is sleepy), Wilf.
