Kasr-el-Nil Barracks  Cairo. 21/3/1915 
 My dear Father & Mother.  The change of scene is only slight & unfortunately  not permanent - at midday Tuesday I marched in  with my picquet (4 officers & 90 men) - My duty was to   send men round the town - to maintain order among  the soldiery, also to send them all home after 10 oclock.  I am able to get a fair idea of the truth of the statements  about the troops' behaviour & I'm Exactly of the same  opinion as before. There are a few rows, but they   are as a rule easily squashed, the drunken men stand  to attention & salute most ceremoniously when you call  them to book - Every morning I have to go to the  Bab-el-Hadid barracks & sign all the charge sheets  of the men arrested.-
