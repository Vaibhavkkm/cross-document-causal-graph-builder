Zietown School of Instruction August 1st, 1915.  Dear Mother I received your 3rd letter yesterday & also Blanches & Gertrudes & also three lots of papers. I have not had much time to write lately as I have been in this School of Instruction & I can tell you we get plenty to do. I don't know what their idea is about putting us here there only 3 of us from the one Company. They say if we pass through we will get Instructors Certificate but I hope they don't keep us here if they do. Because the place is alright for a change but I would not like to stop here. Some chaps I know have taken permanent jobs under the Egyptian Government & others of our Sergeants are taking Commissioned Officers jobs in the Indian Army. There was another big scrap like the one Aunty mentioned last night only it was a good bit worse. It started over one of our chaps being robbed and that started it our chaps rushed the houses & after throwing furniture & other things out of the window they burned 4 big 3 storied houses to the Ground. & when the fire engines come on the scene they cut the hoses & watched the places burn. They give some of the Officers & men on picket a pretty lively time. It provided a bit of amusement for them for a time but they soon forget
about it & go looking for more. Cairo could do with being burned to the ground in most places as it is absolutely rotten, but there is some fine places here especially the Mosques there is about 360 of them in Cairo we went into three of them. One called the Royal Mosque seemed to me to be the best of them. you go into it with slippers over your boots & there is lovely carpets on the floor & the solid gold & ivory & ebony work is simply marvellous & the place inside that is the stone work is all marble & there isn't two pillars alike & every pattern is different & we saw where all the kings of Egypt had been crowned. & we also saw the tombs of some of them. One of the Mosques we went into has got the holes in the sides where Napoleon bombarded the Citadel & there is one Cannon-ball stuck in the wall. I'll tell you another thing about the Mosques that is the amount of lamps in them there must be thousands of them & there is about 4 big ones in each about 20ft across & there is all crystals hanging from them it is simply wonderful. There is one big church in Heliopolis I have been trying to get a photo of it to send you. but I can't get one yet. I wrote a letter last week but somehow or other it got mislaid I found it last night so I thought I would write a longer one this time to make up for it. I dont think I will be able to get
to see Aunty as Alexandria is about 100 miles from here I would have to get a couple of days off to do it & I don't think they would let me off. I. am going to write to her and see if she is still there & If I get a chance I will go down & see her. I am sending Ev a silk affair with this mail. I will send you something next time I went to the Zoological gardens last Sunday Week & Mum you ought to see the way they have got it layed out. They have got a couple of boats that the Turks tried to cross the Canal in & some of the biggest giraffes in the world they must be between 20 & 30 ft hight & they also have got a lovely grotto there it is like all coral caves & it is lovely & cool inside it We have been issued with light shirts & shorts to drill in so we don't mind the drill so much, but we get plenty of it we get up at 4.30 A.M. now so you can see what it would be like. I was glad to hear that you were all keeping well & are getting plenty of rain we don't get a smell of it here. I was also pleased to hear that you had let the house easily You don't want to worry about me mum & Eve says you are The war will soon be over & even if it isn't any that come back from the front say that you have got real bad luck if you get hit they say it is like a picnic & I don't think we are going to Galipolli but by 
all accounts & the lectures we get we are going to  france & if we do we will only go as an army of  occupation but we are not sure. We are going to  be on the move in about a month from now or  even less with a bit of luck. I will send a couple of  P.Cs with this mail & you can see what Heliopolis  is like in most places, I hope Eve is coming over to  see you now & again, & going out with you  I was sorry to hear of Dorothy Casey's Mother  dying it was hard luck, or perhaps it was for the  best. I wrote a P.C. to Grandfather & Grandma & Uncle  John & Dad. I will write him a letter when I get  a bit of time, we don't get much time here as we  get lectures in the day time & have to write them  up at night & I must close now as I have to write  one up, with love to all of you & don't you worry  about me from,  XXXXXXXX  Wally.  PS. Tell Eve to look on the last page of her letter & tell me if the  censor has cut anything out.
