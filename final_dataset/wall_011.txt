Gallipoli Russells Top. November 22nd 1915.  Dear Mum,  Not dead yet you see I suppose you think because  I h you had not received any letter lately that I was either  hurt or had not written but I had. They only send the mail  away from here about once a fortnight now as the sea is very  rough & they can't get the stuff off or on the boats & the last  boat load of Christmas mail from here was sunk at least the  greater part of it was. But I wr wrote a week before that also  so you may have received one of the two lots. I think I wrote  to just about everybody I knew in that mail that was  sunk. By jove mum it is rough & cold here just now & we   have not been issued with our Winter Clothes here yet but we  expect to be within the next few week & I can tell you we  need to be as the cold wind blows right through you & it is not   half as bad as it is supposed to be yet. I received a parcel of sock  from Dad yesterday there was two pair in it & 2 hankerchiefs  & some papers. The socks were good ones & nice & warm & the  handkerchiefs were just the thing & I received your parcel today  & I can tell you that it was just what I wanted. The spyscope  was very handy or will be when we go into the trenches shortly  as we have shifted away from Cheshire Ridge & where we are now  we are only 10 yds apart in places & you can't put a finger up without  getting it shot off & the spyscope will be handier than the big  Periscope we use as we have to move them two & fro or else  we will get a bullet through them & I will be able to put the spyscope  up & it will not be seen. Also the chocolate & Buiscuits  were just the thing, you haven't any knowledge how much we appreciate  something tasty like that after being used to Bacon & Biscuits &  Bully Beef. They were just the thing I can tell you. I don't know  whether you received my letter saying that I had received the pair  of socks you sent me, bu well I received them alright & I think  they were just the thing for a first try & by the time I come  home again you will be quite an expert at them. I also received  a cake from Ev for my Birthday it was about a week late butt  was very acceptable all the same. I have not heard from Aunty   lately but I expect I will shortly. I try to write every week  whilst I have been here but I forget sometimes & it may be a  couple of days late but I always write fairly regular
I received your parcel today but did not receive any letter from  you. I am going to write to Ev tomorrow & also Dad & I may  drop a line to Blanche if I get time. I don't get much time  just now as I am acting Company Sgt Major & will  most likely get the job if I suit & up to date I think  I do. of course I haven't got much chance of any commission  yet but I will perhaps get that if I last out long  enough & all their Freemasons run out. Mum half a dozen  Sgts that I beat easily in the Zeitoun School have got their  Commissions & I have been acting as an officer pretty well  ever since I left Australia & that is the truth. I have not  had an officer in the Trenches with me yet & I think   that I am pretty well the only Sgt that can say that. & I think  that if I am capable to act for that long I am good  enough to hold it. but of course it is not for us to say  I was glad to here that Jack had got a job at Elder-Smith  & Co's Office & be sure & tell him to watch his job  better there as it is no credit to be sacked for giving cheek  & Elder Smith's is a good place to work at. I hope Bob is treating  you better than he used to. If I get the CSM is will be a couple  of bob more to me. But I would sooner have the other chap  back as he was one of my best chums & I was sorry to see  him go away. He had dilated asthma on the Right of his Heart if you   know what that is. I don't. I hope it is a bit livelier & I know it  will be in these trenches than it was in Cheshire Ridge, I used to  go out on the permanent Patrol & we used to go right up to the  Turkish Trenches & if we saw a good chance we would bomb  them it was too slow in the trenches for me, but you needn't  worry about me going out on any more as the job got too slow  for me & I used to go too sleep on the job & got a cold one  night so I left it well alone. Well I suppose it will be a bit late  for Christmas by the time you get this but as the others went down  I will wish you all a Merry Christmas & a Happy New Year. I am  going to send you a couple of Turkish Shells home they are Shells  that have been fired and will be alright for Vases if Brassed or  Nickelled over & will be worth a bit we can get a pound a piece off the  Sailors on the boats here if we like to take them out to them
but I will have to wait until I can get somebody going to  hospital in Egypt & get them to send them home from there  as we can't send them from here & I will also send you home  something from Egypt if I get back there I didn't get much  chance while we were there as I never got a chance to have   too much money but I have got plenty to draw now & I will  be able to send home a good present, I suppose it dissappointed  you or Blanche at not receiving anything from me while I was  in Egypt But as I said before everything comes to those that wait.  I must close now with love to all & I hope all of you are as well as I am.  from "Wally".
