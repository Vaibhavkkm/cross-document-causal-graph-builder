Text:  Had two mails in a week! Recd, some pads from Berna but no pen to hand - Don't send expensive one - as they get rough usage here. Small parcels seem to get thro' easily - but large ones get hung up in Egypt - & so many parcels are missing that Base Details are in for a hot time. As long as the letters come I'm satisfied Boltons sent me 6 or 7 parcels - but only the first got to me - but I believe a parcel mail is about due. I sent for some cigarettes for Jackos dead brother Abdullah burns so much that we want something. We may need 'waders' soon for a winter campaign. However I'm in hopes we wont winter here. The 3rd Brig, has been in trenches for 20 weeks now - & I'm in hopes that after 4 or 5 more weeks we will be pulled out. - If we get fair treatment we should have a fairly long spell & miss the winter part or a lot of it anyhow Just now things are happening which will cause a row in Aust. when we get back. Our chaps are receiving 'Pommy' jackets for men about 5' 3"- boots only sizes 9 & 6 - & for winter underwear thin cotton stuff - & breeches we cut for 'shorts' are not to be replaced, as they were "wilfully damaged"!! Col. Weir has gone away sick - as has Cornish & as Hamilton is ill too I am O.C. practically. I am in good fettle- weigh over 11 stone - am quite O.K. - but our Battn is a very thin line to what it should be. Hen Paul is about 1 mile away - not seen him yet. Much love Wrumps sent me RAVC Mag. V. good.
