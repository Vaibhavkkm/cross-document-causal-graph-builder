Friday    Oct. 9th. We have a better camp party now than when Schwarz and lazy Mark Lewis was with us. It is yet a bit grumpy at times Bob Miller & Sponger Heady are always at one another's necks, is a startling manner. George Hill is a champion fellow Pickering is up "against it" most of the time. The three buglers are only fair, two of them alway under a drop, but Scotty is a real good fellow. This drill is damn monotonous particularly as the non commission officers use the squads to practice on and some of them of very poor. Sagt Coleman does not know decent English, his commands savour of Wooloomaloo. He is a disgrace. Several of the others also are bad. The Corporals are not other than ordinary either.
