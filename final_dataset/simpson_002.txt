09.04.1914  S.S. Yanklililla  Melbourne.    Dear Mother  Just a line to let you know that  we arrived here today Now Mother  I have been in this ship about 2 ½  months so dont write any more  letters to the Tarcoola write to  the mission at Stockton Tell   Annie that I got her letter all  right and the 5 Woodbines but  I did not get those that she sent  to the Mission at Stockton but  I hope to get them this trip if  the Customs have not stopped  them Tell Annie that it was  very good of her to send them  and I will send her something  later on. Well Mother I hope that  this will find you as it leaves  me at present and that it is in  the best of health I have still  got Jack Jackson along with me  he is trimming to me he is getting  on all right he knew about his unkle being dead before I got  your letter I was showing him  round Melbourne last night he  was surprised to see such a fine  city for Newcastle on Tyne is  not a patch on Melb Thats the  worst of you people in the old  country you all seem to think  that Astralia is all bush land  but their are finer and more up  to date cities out here than a lot  of the cities at home Now you  were telling me in your last letter  that you had had Peggy stopping  with you Now Mother why dont   dont you have a bit of sence   about you and keep her out of  your house you should knew by   now that what ever you did for  Peggy she would not have a good  word to say about you even if you  gave her your all and as regards  her talking about you you can  tell her that I will wring neck her   neck if I get home before she gets away 
You were asking me if I ever  saw Will Balneaves Well no I  have not seen him nor have  I wrote to him for I just thought  that if he had wanted to get in  touch with me he could easily have  got my address from you but he  has never wrote to me so I have  not wrote to him it is very strange  that he has not been able to /get  Peggy and the kids out before  now for I know lots of fellows who  paid half the fare and paid the  other half after they have got there  wives out and they have been  out inside of three months of  making the application in Melb.  but I suppose the sooner she gets  about out of your way the sooner  you will be able to live in peace  and quietness I am going to try to  be home about June next year if  I can save a few quid by then  Now Mother I think that this  is all at present so with love to  all at home I remain  Your Loving Son  Jack  P.S. I am sending you a money  order for three quid
