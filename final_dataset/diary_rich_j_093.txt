Sunday    27th The fellows are very disappointed indeed After 6.30 physical drill, we paraded for Church in four partys . I went to the Presbyterian Church. at  Waverly where I believe a farewell sermon has already been preached on two occasions. Dinner with Mrs Sponza. Tea at Narrabeen. Camp at 12 o'clock. Leave only extended to 10.p.m. but there is never any difficulty in getting past the pickets. I got 1 pair of socks & a cap from  Joyce Schaider & a small Shelley poem, from Joan & Helen. It is very  very kind of the, and I must
not forget.
