Pine Wood  Ferndown  Nr. WImborne  20.2.1917   My Dear General Birdwood  So my many thanks for your  very kind letter of sympathy on the loss of the  good old Cornwallis. We were struck by 2 torpedoes,  the 1st at 7.58 am, & the 2nd about 900 ___  As you may imagine, the discipline & conduct of  officers & men were splendid. We had  special stability arrangements for uprighting  the ship when heeled, they worked admirably  & as soon as the ship was upright boats were  got out. In the meantime the destroyer escort kept on  circling the ship so as to keep the submarine down,  & about 8.30 I got her alongside putting about
600 men into her & the final140 into boats.  they were all well clear when 2nd. torp. hit ship though I remained  onboard as I wanted to see the state of  deck below & also paid a visit to my after  cabin to make certain of security of  confidential books - & on going forward  to the fore & aft bridge the 2nd. torpedo hit  us envelopping me in a cloud of water,  steam & flying debris, however providentially  I was unhurt & was able to climb down  the side & drop into my boat before the old ship  turned turtle & sank. The 2nd. torp only missed  the destroyer by a few feet. Ultimately I ordered  all boats crew into Destroyers who took us  all safely to Malta -I was so thankful to know  that barring the loss of 13 lives by explosion  & so proud of conduct of officers  & men that I had the blow much lessened.  I am now on leave & at moment of  writing laid up with acute bronchitis &  gas poisoning, so am rather piano, however  it is great happiness to see my children  again though 1 son is at school & the   other in the "Benbow", the latter I'm glad to  say is fairly happy. As a Court of Inquiry  was held & the young bullies got a dressing   down & kicked out of the ship. I dont know  what my fate will be. I lost one job thro  being sick. I had a very nice letter from  Adl De Robeck. in reply to my yarn telling him about  the ship being sunk, but he said that he had no  power whatever in the way of appointments
in his battlesquadron as that lies entirely [[?]]  the Adty which alas for me though good for the  country is entirely composed of Grand Fleet. officers,  So there is nothing doing for Dardanelles  Captains I expect, however I'm not proud,  & will do any job I'm called upon to do.  I can't do more than satisfy my own  Admirals afloat, for the rest I must wait.  Please excuse this scrawl written in  bed. Im looking forward to the Great  Offensive & only wish I could be your   ADC or orderly  Yours very sincerely,  AP Davidson
