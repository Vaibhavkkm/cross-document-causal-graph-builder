 My dear mother, This is the first line I have attempted to write for about 3 weeks since we started off on our expedition into Palestine which has so far gone very successfully. I cannot hope to tell you very much just now, as we may move again at any moment. Before I commence though, I met Jack about two weeks ago in Beersheba when he was watering his mules very tired & dusty, but otherwise well. Preparations had of course been made for weeks previously, of which I could tell you nothing & finally we started off on our long march. The Mounted troops had to push away Southwards & somewhat West through Khalasa & Asluj before turning North & last to encircle Beersheba. We moved to Khalasa a couple of days before the commencement of the scrap & on the night before the battle marched all night - first through Asluj & then round in a Northerly direction in order to attack Beersheba in flank & rear. I stopped at Asluj & got twelve Motor Ambulances together & set off at daylight next morning to catch up the troops. It was a terribly trying march for them - some 35 miles & no water to be had anywhere. I had considerable trouble with the cars as the roads were merely goat tracks & we had to use shovels in places to make a road, but we eventually reached the troops about 10 a.m. next day. The Infantry were attacking from the front & one of the Mounted Divisions from the flank & rear. We were in reserve till later in the day & were able to watch the battle from a hill. It was as always, a fine spectacle, columns of our horsemen could be seen advancing & then dismounting & attacking Tel el Saba, their artillery pounding away at it to support them, sometimes almost oblitering it with puffs of white shrapnel smoke & dust. Then the enemy artillery which was well served opened on our men & horses & it seemed sometimes as if hardly any could escape when a shell burst right amongst them. The attack attack was gradually pushed until the redoubt was taken, but still more redoubts & strong ones at that remained. A couple of Brigades from our Division were then pushed in, as it was growing dark & one in particular which was led by Colonel Grant who was my Colonel at Gallipoli did brilliant work. Seizing it’s opportunity, they advanced for some 2 or 3 miles at the gallop so as to f get in before dark, & charged right at the Turkish trenches with such demoralizing effect that the Turks gave in & the town was ours. The Brigade took 1200 prisoners & 9 guns & several machine guns.
They had of course some stiff fighting before they finally conquered the place but they made no mistake about it. It was by this time dark & we at Divisional Headquarters were in doubt as to what had happened till finally the news came in.. The Turks had bombed us from aeroplanes a good deal during the day & I was busy evacuating some wounded from one particular place. I have never seen anything more horrible than a spot where a bomb had dropped among some transport & had killed & wounded all the horses & men in the locality. To see fine pairs of horses lying dead in their harness as they dropped was horrible. We had established dressing stations for our wounded & when the news of the fall of Beersheba was known I rushed in with 4 motor Ambulances & some wounded to take over the Turkish Hospital. I was stuck several times in bad ground & finally came to a dead end & was overtaken by Col Dixon who was riding in. He located the hospital & showed me the way to it. It was situated in a fine building, had a staff of 5 doctors & 10 orderlies, a good operating theatre, beds mattresses & quilts to accommodate some 300 patients - not all in the main building , but some in some long low wards at the rear. There was a splendid Pharmacy & Bacteriological Laboratory with an Austrian Pathologist. The place was full of wounded Turks & in the wards at the back were numerous sick ones. As it was about 4 a m. I just had one small ward made ready for the patients I had brought & any others who might arrive & went to bed for a couple of hours in a Turkish bed. I rose at daylight & explored the place, found a stock of Turkish provisions & another fine building nearby also suitable for a hospital. I commenced to empty all the Turkish wounded out of the main building into the wards at the rear & made ready to receive our own who had been housed in the Tent Divisions of the Ambulances during the night on the field of battle. I collected wood & water & made ready for the big rush we soon expected.  About 7.30 our operating ^motor car came along from Khalasa it had been able to proceed by a main metalled road direct as soon as the news came of the fall of Beersheba & was soon followed by a large composite Ambulance which had been formed to act as a Clearing Station & came by the same route as the Motor Operating Theatre 
I handed over the place to them & soon afterwards wounded commenced to arrive & were treated in a  splendid way - urgent operation done when required dressings & hot drinks given & then evacuated  down by the direct main road to railhead by heavy motor Ambulances. If you look at the way we went on our march it was somewhat like this  You can see how far round we went & how  much shorter our evacuation was once Beersheba was taken. I did not mention how weird it was entering Beersheba as I first did in the early hours of the morning in an Ambulance - buildings set on fire by the Turk were blazing freely & the moon was casting a pale light on the buildings & relics of battle. Occasionally I met a guard of our men on some building but for the most part the town was deserted & only an occasional dog or cat rushed across the road. I kept my hand well on my revolver in case of accidents as one  never knew what would turn up next After handing over the hospital next day I joined divisional headquarters again & we eventually took up our quarters in a building & were very comfortable  indeed as we had chairs & tables left behind by the Turks & lamps & many such small accessories to comfort.  But there was much trouble in watering the horses, as the Turks had blown in the  wells & we had great difficulty in pumping up the water as they had spoilt the engines also. So the men had a hard time getting watered & it was at such a time that I met Jack & we had quite a  long chat while we he was waiting for water & discussed home & Australia etc etc. After another day or two we were ordered to move back & waited behind another portion of the line near Sheria which the Infantry were attacking   This was a very strong position but the taking of Beersheba had exposed it's flank & it could be battered from both sides & on this day, we sat on a hill behind the Infantry & watched our guns pound the place to pieces just in front of the attacking Infantry - the biggest bombardment I have seen here. Gradually our shelling moved on & we could see that the Infantry had advanced & the shelling was now on the retreating Turk, it was evident that he was driven out of his stronghold. We received orders to advance some few miles ready to follow on the retreating Turk next morning. We camped by a pretty little Wadi that night but set off about 2a.m. & marched on & on & got into contact with the enemy about midday   They commenced to shell us heavily with large & small guns but we replied & attacked & drove them off & as we advanced on Huj we passed two big 5.9 inch guns which our men had galloped on to & captured (my old Regt - 9th LH had got them). Later that day, the 5th Yeomanry Brigade part  of this Division did a brilliant charge on horseback with swords right in the face of the guns which were firing at them at pointblank range & although they lost several men & a lot of horses which were smashed up by artillery fire at about 40 yards distance, they sabred the gunners & captured 9 field guns & 12 Machine guns. They were almost surrounded themselves but with the aid of their machine guns which came up they drove off the Turks & retained their gains. That night we camped at Huj very tired & thirsty - water terribly scarce the Turks had blown in the well at Huj. A tremendous dump of ammunition of all kinds was captured here & a big signal station & the ground everywhere was  strewn with articles of equipment abandoned by the Turks in their haste - rifles swords belts spare parts machine guns, ^field guns, dead oxen, tents, broken wagons & good wagons, railway trucks at a small branch line at Huj, in fact every possible item of army equipment you could imagine We were now faced with a problem. We had a hundred sick & wounded to dispose of & we were far from our base & still advancing- we must send them back. So we established a tent Subdivision at a place called Jemmama some 4 miles N E of Huj where there was water & here I was left to get rid of these patients as best I could. Fortunately 7 of our motor Ambulances had now turned up & I had about 60 camels with cacolets for wounded. I sent some of these direct back to Sheria c̄ Turkish wounded immediately & then collected all the rest at Jemmama & set off the same afternoon with the first load for Sheria. I arrived there at dusk & it was then too late to return so I stayed the night & set off again at daybreak. I arranged to bring away all remaining serious cases with me & for camels to bring the sick & slightly wounded & all Turks immediately So I went back to Sheria & there stole some more petrol which was running short & as the hospital was now clear I ordered it to be closed & to collect at Huj & rendevouz there c̄ camels & I set off in with couple of motor Ambulances to look for Division. This will finish this letter & I will continue later my dear. Two letters of early September from you have arrived & other mail, Much love, hope you will soon be well settled. I am in splendid health & spirits & Your ever loving son, Wilf.
